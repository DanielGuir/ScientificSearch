      "Combined application of dupilumab and mite allergen-specific immunotherapy in children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.\n",
      "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease that manifests in skin dryness, severe itching, and eczema, and can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. Current treatment regimens do not prevent the recurrence of the disease and are associated with adverse effects. Here, we report two cases of moderate-to-severe AD in children that were treated with dupilumab, a dual inhibitor of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, in combination with mite allergen-specific immunotherapy.\n",
      "Both patients presented with the diagnosis of AD that was not adequately controlled by the conventional treatment regimen, including topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors, emollients, and the traditional Chinese medicine treatments. In both patients, AD-associated skin irritation impacted the quality of life, disturbed sleep patterns, and caused stress and anxiety.Patients received treatment with dupilumab and mite allergen-specific immunotherapy in addition to the baseline treatment regimen of external glucocorticoids (TCS) and oral antihistamines. Nine months after beginning of treatment, clinical symptoms, signs, medication scores, and evaluation scale scores of both children significantly improved, and the treatment was associated with an overall good tolerance.\n",
      "A combination of dupilumab and mite allergen-specific immunotherapy in addition to the standard anti-AD treatment improves clinical symptoms and is not associated with increased incidence of adverse effects.\n",

      "Prevalence of depressive symptoms among seafarers is higher than the general population because of their unique work conditions. Factors that can be changed must be considered and promptly addressed in order to decrease the prevalence of depression. This study aims to clarify the prevalence of depressive symptoms and its related factors among Thai seafarers in an effort to contribute to policies and to prevent depression among Thai seafarers.\n",
      "This cross-sectional study was conducted among 381 male seafarers working onboard ocean-going vessels of five Thai shipping companies. The questionnaire items comprised of personal factors, working factors and depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. First, the chi-square test was used for univariate analysis. Then, variables significantly associated by the chi-square test were used for multivariate logistic regression analysis (employing the stepwise method) as independent variables.\n",
      "The average age of participants in this study was 36.4 years. Prevalence of depressive symptoms was 19.5%. One half of the participants (58.3%) reported subjective sleep problems, and most (75.1%) experienced poor coping behaviors. Two thirds (67.5%) were officers, and 10.1% of participants reported that they sometimes or never performed occupational safety behaviors. Regarding work environments, 62.2% reported that their work was disturbed from performing repetitive tasks. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed two personal factors; sleep problems (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 7.97, 95% Confidence interval (CI) = 3.52-18.05) and poor coping behaviors (AOR = 4.46, 95%CI = 1.61-12.34), and three working factors; job assignment (AOR = 2.50, 95%CI = 1.33-4.70), inadequate occupational safety behaviors (AOR = 4.51, 95%CI = 1.85-11.01) and performing repetitive task (AOR = 2.27, 95%CI = 1.16-4.45), were significantly associated with depression.\n",
      "During COVID-19 pandemic, 19.5% of Thai male seafarers had depressive symptoms. Personal and working factors including subjective sleep problems, poor coping behaviors, job assignment, performing inadequate occupational safety behaviors and performing repetitive tasks were risk factors of depressive symptoms among Thai male seafarers. Monitoring work environment rigorously and coping with work-related stress of the occupational safety behaviors program should be suggested.\n",

Between April and August 2021, participants answered survey questions about several domains (e.g., stress, anxiety, relationships, work, quality of life) that were worsened, improved, or unchanged during the pandemic. We ran a logistic regression estimating the self-reported impact of the pandemic on these domains between two age groups (ages 18-24 versus 25-29).\n",
      "The sample size was 231 (186 non-Latinx Black, 45 Latinx) and mainly male (84.4%) and gay identified (62.2%). Nearly 20% of participants were 18-24 years old and 80% were ages 25-29. Participants who were 18-24 years old reported 2-3 times the odds for having worse sleep quality and mood and greater stress, anxiety, and weight gain compared to those 25-29 years old.\n",
      "Our data provide a nuanced picture of the negative impacts that COVID-19 had on non-Latinx Black and Latinx young adults living with HIV in the U.S. Given that these adults represent a priority population for HIV treatment outcomes, it is critical to better understand the ongoing toll that these dual pandemics have on their lives.\n",

      "This cohort study was based on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study COVID-19 Rapid Response Release and used data collected 5 times between May and December 2020. Indexes of state-level COVID-19 policies (restrictive, supportive) and county-level unemployment rates were used to plausibly address confounding biases through 2-stage limited information maximum likelihood instrumental variables analyses. Data from 6030 US children aged 10 to 13 years were included. Data analysis was conducted from May 2021 to January 2023.\n",

      "In this study, 6030 children were included in the mental health sample (weighted median [IQR] age, 13 [12-13] years; 2947 [48.9%] females, 273 [4.5%] Asian children, 461 [7.6%] Black children, 1167 [19.4%] Hispanic children, 3783 [62.7%] White children, 347 [5.7%] children of other or multiracial ethnicity). After imputing missing data, experiencing financial disruption was associated with a 205.2% [95% CI, 52.9%-509.0%] increase in stress, a 112.1% [95% CI, 22.2%-268.1%] increase in sadness, 32.9% [95% CI, 3.5%-53.4%] decrease in positive affect, and a 73.9 [95% CI, 13.2-134.7] percentage-point increase in moderate-to-extreme COVID-19-related worry. There was no association between school disruption and mental health. Neither school disruption nor financial disruption were associated with sleep.\n",
      "To our knowledge, this study presents the first bias-corrected estimates linking COVID-19 policy-related financial disruptions with child mental health outcomes. School disruptions did not affect indices of children's mental health. These findings suggest public policy should consider the economic impact on families due to pandemic containment measures, in part to protect child mental health until vaccines and antiviral drugs become available.\n",

In the present study, we evaluated the different factors related to increased CG burden in stroke survivors and assessed the relationship between patient's personal and clinical characteristics and CG's stress.\n",
      "In this prospective, follow-up study, a total of 141 principle CGs of 164 First-ever stroke (FES) survivors were subjected to the Caregivers Strain Index (CSI) and Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale (OCBS) at 30 days (n = 141), 90 days (n = 129), and 6 months (n = 119) after informed consent. Patients were subjected to modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel index score assessment at the end of 30 days.\n",
      "The mean age of CG was 49.8 ± 21.0 years, approximately 20 years lesser than that of the patients. 102 (72.34%) CGs were females. Urinary incontinence (p < 0.006) morbidity at 30 days, mRS (p = 0.004), and moderate to the severe neurological deficit on admission (p = 0.003) were the patient factors in FES cases leading to significant CGs stress. CG factors responsible for major stress were long caregiving hours (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), disturbed night sleep (P < 0.001), financial stress (P < 0.001), younger age (P = 0.002), and CGs being daughters-in-law (P = 0.039).\n",

      "Circadian dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease - An updated review.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered to be the most typical form of dementia that provokes irreversible cognitive impairment. Along with cognitive impairment, circadian rhythm dysfunction is a fundamental factor in aggravating AD. A link among circadian rhythms, sleep, and AD has been well-documented. The etiopathogenesis of circadian system disruptions and AD serves some general characteristics that also open up the possibility of viewing them as a mutually reliant path. In this review, we have focused on different factors that are related to circadian rhythm dysfunction. The various pathogenic factors, such as amyloid-beta, neurofibrillary tangles, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and circadian rhythm dysfunction may all contribute to AD. In this review, we also tried to focus on melatonin which is produced from the pineal gland and can be used to treat circadian dysfunction in AD. Aside from amyloid beta, tau pathology may have a notable influence on sleep. Conclusively, the center of this review is primarily based on the principal mechanistic complexities associated with circadian rhythm disruption, sleep deprivation, and AD, and it also emphasizes the potential therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent the progression of AD.\n",

      "Numerical modelling of micron particle inhalation in a realistic nasal airway with pediatric adenoid hypertrophy: A virtual comparison between pre- and postoperative models.\n",
      "Adenoid hypertrophy (AH) is an obstructive condition due to enlarged adenoids, causing mouth breathing, nasal blockage, snoring and/or restless sleep. While reliable diagnostic techniques, such as lateral soft tissue x-ray imaging or flexible nasopharyngoscopy, have been widely adopted in general practice, the actual impact of airway obstruction on nasal airflow and inhalation exposure to drug aerosols remains largely unknown. In this study, the effects of adenoid hypertrophy on airflow and micron particle inhalation exposure characteristics were analysed by virtually comparing pre- and postoperative models based on a realistic 3-year-old nasal airway with AH. More specifically, detailed comparison focused on anatomical shape variations, overall airflow and olfactory ventilation, associated particle deposition in overall and local regions were conducted. Our results indicate that the enlarged adenoid tissue can significantly alter the airflow fields. By virtually removing the enlarged tissue and restoring the airway, peak velocity and wall shear stress were restored, and olfactory ventilation was considerably improved (with a 16∼63% improvement in terms of local ventilation speed). Furthermore, particle deposition results revealed that nasal airway with AH exhibits higher particle filtration tendency with densely packed deposition hot spots being observed along the floor region and enlarged adenoid tissue area. While for the postoperative model, the deposition curve was shifted to the right. The local deposition efficiency results demonstrated that more particles with larger inertia can be delivered to the targeted affected area following Adenoidectomy (Adenoid Removal). Research findings are expected to provide scientific evidence for adenoidectomy planning and aerosol therapy following Adenoidectomy, which can substantially improve present clinical treatment outcomes.\n",

      "(Mis-)use of standard Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta: Results from interviews with users of Tesla's FSD Beta.\n",
      "Tesla's Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD) program introduces technology that extends the operational design domain of standard Autopilot from highways to urban roads. This research conducted 103 in-depth semi-structured interviews with users of Tesla's FSD Beta and standard Autopilot to evaluate the impact on user behavior and perception. It was found that drivers became complacent over time with Autopilot engaged, failing to monitor the system, and engaging in safety-critical behaviors, such as hands-free driving, enabled by weights placed on the steering wheel, mind wandering, or sleeping behind the wheel. Drivers' movement of eyes, hands, and feet became more relaxed with experience with Autopilot engaged. FSD Beta required constant supervision as unfinished technology, which increased driver stress and mental and physical workload as drivers had to be constantly prepared for unsafe system behavior (doing the wrong thing at the worst time). The hands-on wheel check was not considered as being necessarily effective in driver monitoring and guaranteeing safe use. Drivers adapt to automation over time, engaging in potentially dangerous behaviors. Some behavior seems to be a knowing violation of intended use (e.g., weighting the steering wheel), and other behavior reflects a misunderstanding or lack of experience (e.g., using Autopilot on roads not designed for). As unfinished Beta technology, FSD Beta can introduce new forms of stress and can be inherently unsafe. We recommend future research to investigate to what extent these behavioral changes affect accident risk and can be alleviated through driver state monitoring and assistance.\n",

      "Humans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibit sleep disturbances that include insomnia, nightmares, and enhanced daytime sleepiness. Sleep disturbances are considered a hallmark feature of PTSD; however, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating trauma-induced sleep disorders. Using a rodent model of PTSD called \"Single Prolonged Stress\" (SPS) we examined the requirement of the brain-type fatty acid binding protein Fabp7, an astrocyte expressed lipid-signaling molecule, in mediating trauma-induced sleep disturbances.

      "Traumatic brain injury: Mechanisms, manifestations, and visual sequelae.\n",
      "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results when external physical forces impact the head with sufficient intensity to cause damage to the brain. TBI can be mild, moderate, or severe and may have long-term consequences including visual difficulties, cognitive deficits, headache, pain, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic epilepsy. Disruption of the normal functioning of the brain leads to a cascade of effects with molecular and anatomical changes, persistent neuronal hyperexcitation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. Destructive processes that occur at the cellular and molecular level lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, calcium dysregulation, and apoptosis. Vascular damage, ischemia and loss of blood brain barrier integrity contribute to destruction of brain tissue. This review focuses on the cellular damage incited during TBI and the frequently life-altering lasting effects of this destruction on vision, cognition, balance, and sleep. The wide range of visual complaints associated with TBI are addressed and repair processes where there is potential for intervention and neuronal preservation are highlighted.\n",

      "Bullying victimization and suicide attempts among adolescents in 41 low- and middle-income countries: Roles of sleep deprivation and body mass.\n",
      "Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death for adolescents, and globally, over 75% of completed suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Bullying has been proven to be closely related to suicide attempts. However, further understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between bullying and adolescents' suicide attempts is urgently needed.\n",
      "We used data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) (2010-2017) from 41 LMICs or regions. This study was based on questions assessing bullying victimization, suicide attempts, sleep deprivation, and body mass. Chi-square tests were used to explore the correlations among the main variables. The mediating role of sleep deprivation and the moderating role of body mass index (BMI) were analyzed using PROCESS.\n",
      "The results showed a positive association between bullying victimization and suicide attempts. Sleep deprivation partially mediated the relationship between the frequency of being bullied and suicide attempts. In addition, sleep deprivation played a full or partial mediating role in the relationship between different types of bullying and suicide attempts. BMI moderated the relationships between the frequency of being bullied and suicide attempts, between being made fun of about one's body and sleep deprivation, and between sleep deprivation and suicide attempts.\n",
      "Being bullied has a positive effect on suicide attempts, which is mediated by sleep deprivation and moderated by body mass. The results of this study are consistent with the stress-diathesis model of suicide, suggesting that being bullied is one of the stressors of suicide in adolescents, while sleep deprivation and body mass are susceptibility diatheses of suicide. The results are conducive to identifying adolescents at a high risk of suicide, suggesting that there is a need to pay more attention to bullied adolescents, especially their sleep quality and body mass, and design effective intervention measures to improve the current situation of adolescent suicide in LMICs.\n",

      "[Health of technical intern trainees: One-year qualitative longitudinal study after arrival in Japan].\n",
      "Objective　This study aimed to qualitatively analyze changes in the health status and factors affecting technical intern trainees over time during their first year in Japan and examined the necessary support for healthy living.Methods　The study targeted sixteen technical intern trainees who had been living in Japan for almost four months. The study was conducted quarterly in a year, using semi-structured interviews to measure physical and mental health conditions, injury or illness, subjective symptoms, and training and daily life conditions. Dietary content was assessed using photographs taken by participants. Health-check results were collected when available. Data were classified into the six components of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), and further qualitative data were analyzed inductively for health-affecting factors using qualitative longitudinal analysis.Results　The types and timing of illnesses, injuries, subjective symptoms, and health-affecting factors varied. Stress and concerns were experienced by more than 56.3% of each study's participants and more than 44.4% had the possibility of a mood or anxiety disorder. The participants with heavy labor had musculoskeletal disorders in the first half of the study period. The health-check results were in Japanese and some participants did not fully understand them. Fifteen categories were extracted as health-affecting factors:《sleeping conditions》,《joy of independence and anxiety》,《decreased vitality and fatigue》,《undertaking the training》,《communication skills and efforts to learn Japanese》,《efforts for self-health care》,《adaptation to Japanese lifestyle》,《leisure and interaction with Japanese people》,《religious activities》,《training environment》,《living environment》,《support from friends, family and workplace》,《natural environment and economic trends》,《saving-oriented lifestyle》, and《motive for coming to Japan and self-evaluation after one year》.Conclusion　The technical intern trainees experienced various physical and psychological symptoms. Support in maintaining and promoting positive aspects of health-affecting factors and removing negative aspects is important for the health of trainees. In addition, it is important to support the improvement of the health literacy of trainees by offering information on exercise facilities and medical institutions providing health-check services in multiple languages, and improving means of communications through cooperation with related organizations and the use of regular channels by trainees. Furthermore, involving healthcare professionals in \"regional councils\" is necessary.\n",

      "Depression, cardiometabolic disease, and their co-occurrence after childhood maltreatment: an individual participant data meta-analysis including over 200,000 participants.\n",
      "Childhood maltreatment is associated with depression and cardiometabolic disease in adulthood. However, the relationships with these two diseases have so far only been evaluated in different samples and with different methodology. Thus, it remains unknown how the effect sizes magnitudes for depression and cardiometabolic disease compare with each other and whether childhood maltreatment is especially associated with the co-occurrence (\"comorbidity\") of depression and cardiometabolic disease. This pooled analysis examined the association of childhood maltreatment with depression, cardiometabolic disease, and their comorbidity in adulthood.\n",
      "We carried out an individual participant data meta-analysis on 13 international observational studies (N = 217,929). Childhood maltreatment comprised self-reports of physical, emotional, and/or sexual abuse before 18 years. Presence of depression was established with clinical interviews or validated symptom scales and presence of cardiometabolic disease with self-reported diagnoses. In included studies, binomial and multinomial logistic regressions estimated sociodemographic-adjusted associations of childhood maltreatment with depression, cardiometabolic disease, and their comorbidity. We then additionally adjusted these associations for lifestyle factors (smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity). Finally, random-effects models were used to pool these estimates across studies and examined differences in associations across sex and maltreatment types.\n",
      "Childhood maltreatment was associated with progressively higher odds of cardiometabolic disease without depression (OR [95% CI] = 1.27 [1.18; 1.37]), depression without cardiometabolic disease (OR [95% CI] = 2.68 [2.39; 3.00]), and comorbidity between both conditions (OR [95% CI] = 3.04 [2.51; 3.68]) in adulthood. Post hoc analyses showed that the association with comorbidity was stronger than with either disease alone, and the association with depression was stronger than with cardiometabolic disease. Associations remained significant after additionally adjusting for lifestyle factors, and were present in both males and females, and for all maltreatment types.\n",
      "This meta-analysis revealed that adults with a history of childhood maltreatment suffer more often from depression and cardiometabolic disease than their non-exposed peers. These adults are also three times more likely to have comorbid depression and cardiometabolic disease. Childhood maltreatment may therefore be a clinically relevant indicator connecting poor mental and somatic health. Future research should investigate the potential benefits of early intervention in individuals with a history of maltreatment on their distal mental and somatic health (PROSPERO CRD42021239288).\n",

      "Although the number of older women living alone (OWLA) has risen steadily in aging societies, and research has been conducted on depression and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among older adults, research is scarce on the health behaviors of OWLA, including their sleep, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors. Hence, we aimed to identify factors related to depression and HRQoL among this subset of the population, focusing on their health behaviors, using Andersen's model as a research framework.\n",
      "Data for secondary analysis were from the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020). The inclusion criteria were (1) women aged 65 and older and (2) those living alone. We included 794 older South Korean women living alone from 31,051 respondents. We used hierarchical regression analysis, considering sampling weight and a complex sample design, to identify factors related to depression and HRQoL.\n",
      "Among the health behavior factors of Andersen's model as a research framework, sleep was associated with depression, whereas physical activity and sedentary behaviors were related to HRQoL. Subjective health status, limited activity, and perceived stress were associated with both depression and HRQoL. Household income, as an enabling factor, was only associated with HRQoL. The final regression model explained 39% of the variance in depression (p < 0.001) and 37% of the variance in HRQoL (p < 0.001).\n",
      "Our study highlights the importance of strategies to improve specific healthy behaviors that affect depression and HRQoL in OWLA. Appropriate interventions that target increasing physical activity and quality of sleep, and decreasing sedentary behaviors, will be effective to enhance the well-being of OWLA. Healthcare providers should comprehensively understand the characteristics of OWLA and pay more attention to enabling, need, and health behavior factors.\n",

      "Evaluation of sleep and therapeutic education needs of military with PTSD.\n",
      "Sleep disorders in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are both diagnostic (nocturnal reliving) and prognostic. Poor sleep worsens the daytime symptomatology of PTSD and makes it resistant to treatment. However, no specific treatment is codified in France to treat these sleep disorders although sleep therapies (cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, psychoeducation and relaxation) have proven for years to be effective in treating insomnia. Therapeutic sessions can be part of a therapeutic patient education program, which is a model for the management of chronic pathologies. It allows for an improvement in a patient's quality of life and enhanced medication compliance. We therefore carried out an inventory of sleep disorders of patients with PTSD. First, we collected data by means of sleep diaries concerning the population's sleep disorders at home. Then we assessed the population's expectations and needs regarding its management of sleep, thanks to a semi-qualitative interview. The data from sleep diaries, which was consistent with the literature, showed that our patients suffered from severe sleep disorders that strongly impact their daily lives, with 87% of patients having an increased sleep onset latency, and 88% having nightmares. We observed a strong demand from patients for specific support for these symptoms, 91% expressing an interest in a TPE program targeting sleep disorders. Thanks to the data collected, the emerging themes for a future therapeutic patient education program targeting sleep disorders of soldiers with PTSD are: sleep hygiene; management of nocturnal awakenings, including nightmares; and psychotropic drugs.\n",

      "Polysomnographic Assessment of Sleep Disturbances in Cancer Development: A Historical Multicenter Clinical Cohort Study.\n",
      "Many cellular processes are controlled by sleep. Alterations in sleep might therefore be expected to stress biological systems that could influence malignancy risk.\n",
      "What is the association between polysomnographic (PSG) measures of sleep disturbances and incident cancer, as well as the validity of cluster analysis in identifying PSG phenotypes?\n",
      "We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study using linked clinical and provincial health administrative data on consecutive adults free of cancer at baseline with PSG data collected between 1994 and 2017 in four academic hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Cancer status was derived from registry records. PSG phenotypes were identified by K-Means cluster analysis. A combination of validation statistics and distinguishing PSG features were used to select clusters. Cox cause-specific regressions were used to assess the relationship between identified clusters and incident cancer.\n",
      "Among 29,907 individuals, 2,514 (8.4%) developed cancer over a median of 8.0 years (IQR: 4.2-13.5). Five clusters were identified: 'Mild' (mildly abnormal PSG), 'Poor Sleep,' 'Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Sleep Fragmentation,' 'Severe Desaturations,' and 'Periodic Limb Movements (PLMS).' The associations between cancer and all clusters compared to 'Mild' were significant while controlling for clinic and year of the PSG. When additionally controlling for age and sex, the effect remained significant only for 'PLMS' (adjusted hazard ratios [aHR] of 1.26; 1.06-1.50) and 'Severe Desaturations' (aHR of 1.32; 1.04-1.66). Further controlling for confounders, the effect remained significant for 'PLMS,' but was attenuated for 'Severe Desaturations.'\n",
      "In a large cohort, we confirm the importance of PSG phenotypes and highlight the role that PLMS and oxygenation desaturation may play in cancer. Using this study's findings, we have also developed an excel spreadsheet (PSG Cluster Classifier) that can be used to validate the identified clusters on new data or identify which cluster a patient belongs to.\n",

      "Sleep Disturbances in Adolescents With Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.\n",
      "We aimed to assess the presence of sleep disturbances in adolescents with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and to determine whether demographic, anthropometric, and clinical factors are associated with disrupted sleep.\n",
      "Sleep disturbances and patterns were evaluated in a cohort of adolescents (aged 12 to 18 years) with ongoing IIH and compared with a healthy age- and sex-matched control group. All participants responded to three self-rating questionnaires: the School Sleep Habits Survey (SSHS), the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. The study group's demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were documented, and their association with sleep patterns was examined.\n",
      "Thirty-three adolescents with ongoing IIH and 71 healthy controls were included. There was a significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances in the IIH group compared with the controls (SSHS, P < 0.001 and PSQ, P < 0.001), as well as of their independent subscales: sleep-related breathing disorders (P = 0.006), daytime sleepiness (P = 0.04), sleep/wake disruptions (P < 0.001), and sleep-related depressive tendencies (P < 0.001). According to subgroup analyses, these differences were also present between the normal-weight adolescents but not between the overweight IIH and control adolescents. No differences were found in the demographic, anthropometric, and IIH disease-related clinical measures between individuals with IIH with disrupted and normal sleep patterns.\n",
      "Sleep disturbances are common among adolescents with ongoing IIH, irrespective of their weight and disease-related characteristics. Screening adolescents with IIH for sleep disturbances is recommended as part of their multidisciplinary management.\n",

      "Relationship between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers prescribing and delirium in the ICU-A secondary analysis.\n",
      "Studies suggest Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) may slow the decline of memory function in individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease by regulating migroglial activation and oxidative stress within the brain's reticular activating system. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between delirium prevalence and being prescribed ACEI and ARB in participants admitted to the intensive care units (ICU).\n",
      "A secondary analysis of data from two parallel pragmatic randomized controlled trials was performed. ACEI and ARB exposure was defined as being prescribed an ACEI or an ARB within six months prior to the ICU admission. The primary endpoint was the first positive delirium assessment based on Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) for up to thirty days.\n",
      "A total of 4791 patients admitted to the medical, surgical, and progressive ICU and screened for eligibility for the parent studies between February 2009 and January 2015 from two level 1 trauma and one safety net hospital in a large urban academic health system were included. Delirium rates in the ICU were not significantly different among participants with no exposure to ACEI/ARB (12.6%), or exposure to ACEI (14.4%), ARB (11.8%), or ACEI and ARB in combination (15.4%) in six months prior to the ICU admission. Exposure to ACEI (OR = 0.97[0.77, 1.22]), ARB (OR = 0.70 [0.47, 1.05]), or both (OR = 0.97 [0.33, 2.89]) in six months prior to ICU admission was not significantly associated with odds of delirium during the ICU admission after adjusting for age, gender, race, co-morbidities, and insurance status.\n",
      "While the impact of ACEI and ARB exposure prior to the ICU admission was not associated with the prevalence of delirium in this study, further research is needed to fully understand the impact of antihypertensive medications on delirium.\n",

A total of 52 college students were recruited and randomized to the coaching (n = 28) or the control group (n = 24). The coaching group met with a trained peer health coach once a week for 8 weeks focusing on self-selected wellness domains. Coaching techniques included reflective listening, motivational interviews, and goal setting. The control group received a wellness handbook. PA, self-efficacy for eating healthy foods, quality of sleep, social isolation, positive affect and well-being, anxiety, and cognitive function were measured.

      "Potential of Polyphenols for Improving Sleep: A Preliminary Results from Review of Human Clinical Trials and Mechanistic Insights.\n",
      "Global epidemiologic evidence supports an interrelationship between sleep disorders and fruits and vegetable ingestion. Polyphenols, a broad group of plant substances, are associated with several biologic processes, including oxidative stress and signaling pathways that regulate the expression of genes promoting an anti-inflammatory environment. Understanding whether and how polyphenol intake is related to sleep may provide avenues to improve sleep and contribute to delaying or preventing the development of chronic disease. This review aims to assess the public health implications of the association between polyphenol intake and sleep and to inform future research. The effects of polyphenol intake, including chlorogenic acid, resveratrol, rosmarinic acid, and catechins, on sleep quality and quantity are discussed to identify polyphenol molecules that may improve sleep. Although some animal studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of polyphenols on sleep, the paucity of trials, especially randomized controlled trials, does not allow for conducting a meta-analysis to reach clear conclusions about the relationships among these studies to support the sleep-improving effects of polyphenols.\n",

      "Complementary Therapy Learning in the Setting of Lung Transplantation: A Single-Center Observational Study of Appropriation and Efficacy.\n",
      "Transplanted patients could benefit from complementary techniques. This prospective single-center, open study, performed in a tertiary university hospital, evaluates the appropriation and efficacy of a toolbox-kit of complementary techniques. Self-hypnosis, sophrology, relaxation, holistic gymnastics, and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) were taught to adult patients scheduled for double-lung transplantation. Patients were asked to use them before and after transplantation, as needed. The primary outcome was appropriation of each technique within the first three postoperative months. Secondary outcomes included efficacy on pain, anxiety, stress, sleep, and quality-of-life. Among the 80 patients included from May 2017 to September 2020, 59 were evaluated at the 4th postoperative month. Over the 4359 sessions performed, the most frequent technique used before surgery was relaxation. After transplantation, the techniques most frequently used were relaxation and TENS. TENS was the best technique in terms of autonomy, usability, adaptation, and compliance. Self-appropriation of relaxation was the easiest, while self-appropriation of holistic gymnastics was difficult but appreciated by patients. In conclusion: the appropriation by patients of complementary therapies such as mind-body therapies, TENS and holistic gymnastics is feasible in lung transplantation. Even after a short training session, patients regularly practiced these therapies, mainly TENS and relaxation.\n",

      "Loss of Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity in an In Vitro Model Subjected to Intermittent Hypoxia: Is Reversion Possible with a HIF-1α Pathway Inhibitor?\n",
      "Several sleep-related breathing disorders provoke repeated hypoxia stresses, which potentially lead to neurological diseases, such as cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, consequences of repeated intermittent hypoxia on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are less recognized. This study compared two methods of intermittent hypoxia induction on the cerebral endothelium of the BBB: one using hydralazine and the other using a hypoxia chamber. These cycles were performed on an endothelial cell and astrocyte coculture model. Na-Fl permeability, tight junction protein, and ABC transporters (P-gp and MRP-1) content were evaluated with or without HIF-1 inhibitors YC-1. Our results demonstrated that hydralazine as well as intermittent physical hypoxia progressively altered BBB integrity, as shown by an increase in Na-Fl permeability. This alteration was accompanied by a decrease in concentration of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin-5. In turn, microvascular endothelial cells up-regulated the expression of P-gp and MRP-1. An alteration was also found under hydralazine after the third cycle. On the other hand, the third intermittent hypoxia exposure showed a preservation of BBB characteristics. Furthermore, inhibition of HIF-1α with YC-1 prevented BBB dysfunction after hydralazine treatment. In the case of physical intermittent hypoxia, we observed an incomplete reversion suggesting that other biological mechanisms may be involved in BBB dysfunction. In conclusion, intermittent hypoxia led to an alteration of the BBB model with an adaptation observed after the third cycle.\n",

      "Aims of this study were to test whether sleep fragmentation (SF) increased carcinogenesis and to investigate the possible mechanisms of carcinogenesis in a chemical-induced colon cancer model. In this study, eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were divided into Home cage (HC) and SF groups. After the azoxymethane (AOM) injection, the mice in the SF group were subjected to SF for 77 days. SF was accomplished in a sleep fragmentation chamber. In the second protocol, mice were divided into 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-treated, HC, and SF groups and were exposed to the HC or SF procedures. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent stainings were conducted to determine the level of 8-OHdG and reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the relative expression of inflammatory and ROS-generating genes. The number of tumors and average tumor size were significantly higher in the SF group than in the HC group. The intensity (%) of the 8-OHdG stained area was significantly higher in the SF group than in the HC group. The fluorescence intensity of ROS was significantly higher in the SF group than the HC group. SF accelerated cancer development in a murine AOM/DSS-induced model of colon cancer, and the increased carcinogenesis was associated with ROS- and oxidative stress-induced DNA damage.\n",

      "Factors Associated with Increased or Decreased Stress Level in French Children during the First COVID-19 Lockdown.\n",
      "In spring 2020, governments of many countries implemented lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Worldwide, the pandemic forced about 1.5 billion children to stay at home for several weeks and to experience homeschooling. The objective of this study was to assess the variation in stress levels and associated factors in school-aged children in France during the first COVID-19 lockdown. A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire was designed by an interdisciplinary team involving hospital child psychiatrists and school doctors. Between 15 June and 15 July 2020, Educational Academy of Lyon (France) invited the parents of school-aged children to participate in this survey. The first part of the questionnaire concerned the children with data on lockdown conditions, socio-demographic data, daily rhythms (eating and sleeping), perceived stress variations, and feelings. The second part assessed parental perspectives on their child's psychological state and use of the mental health care system. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with stress variation (increased or decreased). A total of 7218 questionnaires were fully completed by children from elementary school to high school with a balanced sex ratio. In summary, 29% of children reported a higher stress level during the lockdown, 34% reported a lower stress level, and 37% reported no stress variation in the usual situation prior to COVID-19. Parents were most often able to identify signs of increased stress levels in their children. The most influential factors in the variation of stress for children were academic pressure, family relationships, and fear of being infected or infecting a family member with SARS-CoV-2. Our study underlines the high impact of school attendance stressors on children in usual conditions and encourages vigilance for children whose stress levels have decreased during the lockdown but who may have increased difficulty re-exposing themselves upon deconfinement.\n",

      "With the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, it was stipulated that patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may have a greater risk of morbidity and mortality and may even experience changes in their mental health. The aim of the current study is to evaluate how patients managed their disease (sleep apnea) during the COVID-19 pandemic, to determine if continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) usage changed after the beginning of the pandemic, to compare the stress level with the baseline, and to observe if any modifications are related to their individual characteristics. The present studies highlight the level of anxiety, which was high among patients with OSA during the COVID-19 pandemic (\n",

      "Life Habits of Healthcare Professionals during the Third Wave of COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study in a Spanish Hospital.\n",
      "(1) Background: To describe sleep quality, eating behaviour and alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use among healthcare staff in a Spanish public hospital. (2) Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study examining sleep quality (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), eating behaviour (Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (R18)), tobacco and drug use (ESTUDES questionnaire) and alcohol use (Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener). (3) Results: 178 people, of whom 87.1% (155) were women, with an average age of 41.59 ± 10.9 years. A total of 59.6% of the healthcare workers had sleep problems, to a greater or lesser degree. The average daily consumption was 10.56 ± 6.74 cigarettes. The most commonly used drugs included cannabis, occasionally used by 88.37%, cocaine (4.75%), ecstasy (4.65%) and amphetamines (2.33%). A total of 22.73% of participants had increased their drug use, and 22.73% had increased their consumption during the pandemic, with beer and wine accounting for 87.2% of drinks consumed during this period. (4) Conclusions: In addition to the psychological and emotional impact already demonstrated, the COVID-19 crisis has repercussions on sleep quality, eating behaviour and alcohol, tobacco and drug consumption. Psychological disturbances have repercussions on physical and functional aspects of healthcare workers. It is feasible that these alterations are due to stress, and it is necessary to act through treatment and prevention as well as promote healthy habits.\n",

      "Partnerships at the Interface of Education and Mental Health Services: The Utilisation and Acceptability of the Provision of Specialist Liaison and Teacher Skills Training.\n",
      "Partnerships between school staff and mental health professionals have the potential to improve access to mental health support for students, but uncertainty remains regarding whether and how they work in practice. We report on two pilot projects aimed at understanding the implementation drivers of tailored strategies for supporting and engaging front-line school staff in student mental health. The first project provided regular, accessible mental health professionals with whom school staff could meet and discuss individual or systemic mental health concerns (a school 'InReach' service), and the other offered a short skills training programme on commonly used psychotherapeutic techniques (the School Mental Health Toolbox; SMHT). The findings from the activity of 15 InReach workers over 3 years and 105 individuals who attended the SMHT training demonstrate that school staff made good use of these services. The InReach workers reported more than 1200 activities in schools (notably in providing specialist advice and support, especially for anxiety and emotional difficulties), whilst most SMHT training attendees reported the utilisation of the tools (in particular, supporting better sleep and relaxation techniques). The measures of acceptability and the possible impacts of the two services were also positive. These pilot studies suggest that investment into partnerships at the interface of education and mental health services can improve the availability of mental health support to students.\n",

      "Prevalence of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders and Its Effects amongst Nurses in the Selected Intellectual Disability Unit of the Limpopo Province.\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic continuously highlights the need for occupational health and safety among healthcare professionals. Physical and mental health safety resulting from needle prick injuries, stress, infections, and chemical hazards are priority work-related musculoskeletal disorders for nurses, including those working in the intellectual disability unit. The intellectual disability unit provides basic nursing care to patients with known mental disabilities, such as learning, problem-solving, and judgment problems, which demand diverse physical activities. Nevertheless, the safety of nurses within the unit receives little attention. Thus, we adopted a quantitative cross-sectional epidemiological survey design to determine the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders amongst nurses working in the intellectual disability unit at the selected hospital in Limpopo Province, South Africa. A self-administered questionnaire collected data from 69 randomly selected nurses from the intellectual disability unit. Data were extracted, coded, and captured in MS Excel format (2016) and imported into the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), software version 25.0, for analysis. The study reported a low (38%) prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in the intellectual disability unit, with significant effects on nursing care and staffing. The effects of these WMSDs included missing work, interference with the daily routine, disturbance with sleeping patterns after work, and absenteeism from work. Since intellectually disabled patients depend entirely on nurses for the basic activities of daily living, this paper recommends the incorporation of physiotherapy among nurses in the intellectual disability unit to treat the incidence of lower back pain while mitigating nurses missing work or absenteeism.\n",

      "Identifying modifiable factors that may predict long-term cognitive decline in the elderly with adequate daily functionality is critical. Such factors may include poor sleep quality and quantity, sleep-related breathing disorders, inflammatory cytokines and stress hormones, as well as mental health problems. This work reports the methodology and descriptive characteristics of a long-term, multidisciplinary study on modifiable risk factors for cognitive status progression, focusing on the 7-year follow-up. Participants were recruited from a large community-dwelling cohort residing in Crete, Greece (CAC; Cretan Aging Cohort). Baseline assessments were conducted in 2013-2014 (Phase I and II, circa 6-month time interval) and follow-up in 2020-2022 (Phase III). In total, 151 individuals completed the Phase III evaluation. Of those, 71 were cognitively non-impaired (CNI group) in Phase II and 80 had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In addition to sociodemographic, lifestyle, medical, neuropsychological, and neuropsychiatric data, objective sleep was assessed based on actigraphy (Phase II and III) and home polysomnography (Phase III), while inflammation markers and stress hormones were measured in both phases. Despite the homogeneity of the sample in most sociodemographic indices, MCI persons were significantly older (mean age = 75.03 years, SD = 6.34) and genetically predisposed for cognitive deterioration (APOE ε4 allele carriership). Also, at follow-up, we detected a significant increase in self-reported anxiety symptoms along with a substantial rise in psychotropic medication use and incidence of major medical morbidities. The longitudinal design of the CAC study may provide significant data on possible modifiable factors in the course of cognitive progression in the community-dwelling elderly.\n",

      "Defining and quantifying fatigue in the rugby codes.\n",
      "The rugby codes (i.e., rugby union, rugby league, rugby sevens [termed 'rugby']) are team-sports that impose multiple complex physical, perceptual, and technical demands on players which leads to substantial player fatigue post-match. In the post-match period, fatigue manifests through multiple domains and negatively influences recovery. There is, however, currently no definition of fatigue contextualised to the unique characteristics of rugby (e.g., locomotor and collision loads). Similarly, the methods and metrics which practitioners consider when quantifying the components of post-match fatigue and subsequent recovery are not known. The aims of this study were to develop a definition of fatigue in rugby, to determine agreement with this common definition of fatigue, and to outline which methods and metrics are considered important and feasible to implement to quantify post-match fatigue. Subject matter experts (SME) undertook a two-round online Delphi questionnaire (round one; n = 42, round two; n = 23). SME responses in round one were analysed to derive a definition of fatigue, which after discussion and agreement by the investigators, obtained 96% agreement in round two. The SME agreed that fatigue in rugby refers to a reduction in performance-related task ability which is underpinned by time-dependent negative changes within and between cognitive, neuromuscular, perceptual, physiological, emotional, and technical/tactical domains. Further, there were 33 items in the neuromuscular performance, cardio-autonomic, or self-report domains achieved consensus for importance and/or feasibility to implement. Highly rated methods and metrics included countermovement jump force/power (neuromuscular performance), heart rate variability (cardio-autonomic measures), and soreness, mood, stress, and sleep quality (self-reported assessments). A monitoring system including highly-rated fatigue monitoring objective and subjective methods and metrics in rugby is presented. Practical recommendations of objective and subjective measures, and broader considerations for testing and analysing the resulting data in relation to monitoring fatigue are provided.\n",

      "Effects of a Mobile-Based Intervention for Parents of Children With Crying, Sleeping, and Feeding Problems: Randomized Controlled Trial.\n",
      "Excessive crying, sleeping, and feeding problems in early childhood are major stressors that can result in parents feeling socially isolated and having low self-efficacy. Affected children are a risk group for being maltreated and developing emotional and behavioral problems. Thus, the development of an innovative and interactive psychoeducational app for parents of children with crying, sleeping, and feeding problems may provide low-threshold access to scientifically based information and reduce negative outcomes in parents and children.\n",
      "We aimed to investigate whether following the use of a newly developed psychoeducational app, the parents of children with crying, sleeping, or feeding problems experienced less parenting stress; gained more knowledge about crying, sleeping, and feeding problems; and perceived themselves as more self-effective and as better socially supported and whether their children's symptoms decreased more than those of the parents who did not use the app.\n",
      "Our clinical sample consisted of 136 parents of children (aged 0-24 months) who contacted a cry baby outpatient clinic in Bavaria (Southern Germany) for an initial consultation. Using a randomized controlled design, families were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (IG; 73/136, 53.7%) or a waitlist control group (WCG; 63/136, 46.3%) during the usual waiting time until consultation. The IG was given a psychoeducational app that included evidence-based information via text and videos, a child behavior diary function, a parent chat forum and experience report, tips on relaxation, an emergency plan, and a regional directory of specialized counseling centers. Outcome variables were assessed using validated questionnaires at baseline test and posttest. Both groups were compared at posttest regarding changes in parenting stress (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes, namely knowledge about crying, sleeping, and feeding problems; perceived self-efficacy; perceived social support; and child symptoms.\n",
      "The mean individual study duration was 23.41 (SD 10.42) days. The IG reported significantly lower levels of parenting stress (mean 83.18, SD 19.94) after app use compared with the WCG (mean 87.46, SD 16.67; P=.03; Cohen d=0.23). Furthermore, parents in the IG reported a higher level of knowledge about crying, sleeping, and feeding (mean 62.91, SD 4.30) than those in the WCG (mean 61.15, SD 4.46; P<.001; Cohen d=0.38). No differences at posttest were found between groups in terms of parental efficacy (P=.34; Cohen d=0.05), perceived social support (P=.66; Cohen d=0.04), and child symptoms (P=.35; Cohen d=0.10).\n",
      "This study provides initial evidence of the efficacy of a psychoeducational app for parents with child crying, sleeping, and feeding problems. By reducing parental stress and increasing knowledge of children's symptoms, the app has the potential to serve as an effective secondary preventive measure. Additional large-scale studies are needed to investigate long-term benefits.\n",

      "The prevalence and use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) varies widely across Europe. Historically, Switzerland played an important role in the worldwide spread of ECT. Nevertheless, an overview of current ECT practice in Switzerland is still lacking. The present study aims to fill this gap.\n",
      "A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017 using a standardized questionnaire to investigate current ECT practice in Switzerland. Fifty-one Swiss hospitals were contacted by email and followed up by telephone. In early 2022, we updated the list of facilities that offer ECT.\n",
      "Thirty eight of the 51 hospitals (74.5%) provided feedback to the questionnaire, 10 of them claimed to offer ECT. They reported 402 treated patients, which corresponds to an ECT-treated person rate of 4.8 persons per 100,000 inhabitants. Depression was the most frequent indication. All hospitals reported an increase in ECT treatments between 2014 and 2017 except for one with constant numbers. The number of facilities offering ECT almost doubled between 2010 and 2022. Most ECT facilities performed the treatment predominantly on an outpatient rather than an inpatient basis.\n",
      "Historically, Switzerland relevantly contributed to the worldwide spread of ECT. In an international comparison, the treatment frequency is in the lower middle range. The outpatient treatment rate is high compared with other countries in Europe. The supply and spread of ECT in Switzerland have increased over the past decade.\n",

      "The Impact of COVID-19 on Members of the Saudi Community: Perceptions and Expectations From the Pandemic.\n",
      "Background and purpose Community individuals and sectors worldwide, including health, security, economy, education, and occupation, are being challenged to confront the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The deadly virus originated in Wuhan city in China and spread globally to other countries on account of its rapid mode of transmission. Solidarity and cooperation were vital elements in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic all around the globe. Actions of solidarity among countries included gathering the world's leading experts to discuss the latest research and innovation while working to promote knowledge and empowerment across the communities. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on different aspects of the Saudi community, including health, education, finance, lifestyle, and others. We also wanted to identify the perceptions of the general Saudi population regarding the impact of the pandemic and its long-term effects. Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2020 to February 2021 among individuals across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The online self-developed survey was disseminated to thousands of individuals in the Saudi community and yielded 920 responses. Results Roughly 49% of the studied participants postponed their dental and cosmetic center appointments, and 31% reported delayed periodic health appointments in hospitals and primary healthcare centers. Around 64% reported missing hearing \"Tarawih/Qiyam\" Islamic prayers. Furthermore, 38% of the study respondents reported being anxious and stressed, 23% reported having sleeping disorders, and 16% wanted to be isolated from the community. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic helped approximately 65% of the studied participants to abstain from ordering from restaurants and cafes. Additionally, 63% of them reported gaining new skills or behaviors during the pandemic. Many participants (54%) thought that after the curfew recession, they will face financial challenges while 44% assumed that life will not return to what it used to be. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has had a multidimensional impact on Saudi society, which has affected both individuals and the community as a whole. Some of the short-term perceived impacts involved interruption in the provision of health care, poor mental well-being, financial hardship, challenges related to homeschooling and working from home, and the inability to fulfill spiritual needs. On the bright side, community individuals demonstrated the ability to learn and develop during the pandemic by striving to acquire knowledge and new skills.\n",

      "Social restrictions due to COVID-19 have impacted the everyday life of adolescents and young adults, with increased levels of stress and anxiety being reported. Therefore, we report primary care visits due to mental health problems and the use of psychotropic medication in Finland.\n",
      "We conducted a nationwide register-based study and included primary care visits with mental health problems (F*-class ICD-10 diagnosis) for patients aged 15-24 years. We calculated incidence for visits and used incidence rate ratios (IRR) for comparisons. Psychotropic medication purchases for patients aged 13-24 years were included. Annual psychotropic medication user prevalence per 1000 was calculated and prevalence rate ratios (PRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for comparisons. The years 2020 and 2021 were compared to the pre-pandemic reference year 2019.\n",
      "A total of 396534 visits to primary care due to mental health problems were included. Annual visit incidences per 1000 were 151.7 in 2019, 193.6 in 2020, and 306.7 in 2021, indicating a 28% (IRR 1.28, CI 1.27-1.29) increase from 2019 to 2020 and a 102% (IRR 2.02, CI:2.01-2.04) increase from 2019 to 2021. Highest reported increases in 2020 were sleeping disorders (IRR 1.79, CI 1.72-1.87) and anxiety disorders (IRR 1.39, CI 1.37-1.42). Prevalence of antidepressant use increased by 25% (PRR 1.25, CI 1.23-1.26) in 2021. An increase was also seen in the use of antipsychotics (+ 19%, PRR 1.19. CI 1.16-1.21).\n",

      "Neuronal glutamate transporters are associated with cognitive impairment in obstructive sleep apnea patients without dementia.\n",
      "Increasing evidence supports a link between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cognition, and the mechanism is complex and still not well understood. We analyzed the relationship between the glutamate transporters and cognitive impairment in OSA. For this study 317 subjects without dementia, including 64 healthy controls (HCs), 140 OSA patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 113 OSA patients without cognitive impairment were assessed. All participants who completed polysomnography, cognition and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume were used. Plasma neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) proteins were measured by ELISA kits. After 1 year of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, we analyzed plasma NDEs EAAT2 level and cognition changes. Plasma NDEs EAAT2 level was significantly higher in OSA patients than in HCs. Higher plasma NDEs EAAT2 level were significantly associated with cognitive impairment than normal cognition in OSA patients. Plasma NDEs EAAT2 level was inversely associated with the total Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, visuo-executive function, naming, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation. One year after CPAP treatment, plasma NDEs EAAT2 level (P = 0.019) was significantly lower, while MoCA scores (P = 0.013) were significantly increased compared with baseline. Upregulation of neuronal glutamate transporters at baseline may reflect a self-compensatory mechanism to prevent further neuronal damage, while plasma NDEs EAAT2 level was decreased after one year of CPAP therapy, which may be due to the loss of astrocytes and neurons.\n",

      "The Brief Measure of Preoperative Emotional Stress (B-MEPS) is a suitable screening tool for Preoperative Emotional Stress (PES). However, personalized decision-making demands practical interpretation of the refined version of B-MEPS. Thus, we propose and validate cut-off points on the B-MEPS to classify PES. Also, we assessed if the cut-off points screened preoperative maladaptive psychological features and predicted postoperative opioid use.\n",
      "This observational study comprises samples of two other primary studies, with 1009 and 233 individuals, respectively. The latent class analysis derived emotional stress subgroups using B-MEPS items. We compared membership with the B-MEPS score through the Youden index. Concurrent criterion validity of the cut-off points was performed with the severity of preoperative depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, central sensitization, and sleep quality. Predictive criterion validity was performed with opioid use after surgery.\n",
      "We chose a model with three classes labeled mild, moderate, and severe. The Youden index points -0.1663 and 0.7614 of the B-MEPS score classify individuals, in the severe class, with a sensitivity of 85.7% (80.1%-90.3%) and specificity of 93.5% (91.5%-95.1%). The cut-off points of the B-MEPS score have satisfactory concurrent and predictive criterion validity.\n",
      "These findings showed that the preoperative emotional stress index on the B-MEPS offers suitable sensitivity and specificity for discriminating the severity of preoperative psychological stress. They provide a simple tool to identify patients prone to severe PES related to maladaptive psychological features, which might influence the perception of pain and analgesic opioid use in the postoperative period.\n",

      "Nightmare disorder consists of the appearance of unpleasant and vivid, repeated dreams, with a situation of discomfort and anguish on awakening. Its prevalence is 3%-4% in adults. They do not associate muscle mobilization during this phase. REM sleep behavior disorder (RSBD) is a rare parasomnia (0.5% of people older than 60 years of age), characterized by the presence of unpleasant dreams, with violent content, and vigorous movements of limbs (kicks and punches), reflecting a loss of muscle atony typical of the REM phase of sleep. Language (screams and words) can also be emitted. The same clinical manifestations of RSBD can appear in other sleep disorders. The diagnosis requires the performance of a polysomnography.\n",

      "25% of dentists fell within generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis, compared to a maximum of 8.6% in the general population. A possible general biomarker of excessive stress response was measured: a shift of circadian sympathetic activity was found in dentists; a higher activity during sleep in comparison to working time and daytime. The Female gender was associated with higher perceived patient-approach anxiety, lower parasympathetic activity, and a comparable sympathetic activity to the Male gender, thus fostering a possible vulnerability to excessive stress. This study underlines the need to empower the psychological approach to stress and patient-relationship in dentistry.\n",

      "Sleep problems are a growing public health concern being related, among others, to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases or worse cognitive functioning. In addition, they can affect aspects related to personal motivation and quality of life. However, very few studies have analysed the possible determinants of sleep quality in the adult population as a whole, establishing patterns based on these determinants.The objectives are to evaluate the determinants of sleep quality in a representative sample of the general adult population between 25 and 65 years old, and to establish patterns of sleep quality based on lifestyles, psychological factors, morbidities, sociodemographic variables, biological markers and other possible determinants.\n",
      "Descriptive observational cross-sectional study. The study population will include a representative sample of 500 people between 25 and 65 years old from the cities of Salamanca and Ávila (Spain) selected by random sampling stratified by age groups and sex. A 90-minute visit will be performed, during which sleep quality will be assessed. The variables collected will be: morbidity, lifestyles (physical activity, diet, toxic habits), psychological factors (depression, stress, occupational stress and anxiety), socioeconomic and work-related variables, habitability conditions of the habitual residence and rest area, screen time, relaxation techniques and melatonin as a biological marker related to sleep quality.\n",
      "With the results of this work, improved interventions for behaviour modification could be designed, as well as intervention and education programmes or other research aimed at improving sleep quality.\n",
      "This study has a favourable opinion from the Ethics Committee for Drug Research of the Health Areas of Salamanca and Ávila (CEim Code: PI 2021 07 815). The results of this study will be published in international impact journals of different specialties.\n",

      "Sleep spindles favor emotion regulation over memory consolidation of stressors in PTSD.\n",
      "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma-induced condition, characterized by intrusive memories and trauma-associated anxiety. Here, NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep spindles might play a crucial role in learning and consolidating declarative stressor information. However, sleep, and possibly sleep spindles, are also known to regulate anxiety, suggestive of a dual role for sleep spindles in the processing of stressors. Specifically, in high PTSD symptom individuals, spindles might fail to regulate anxiety levels after exposure and instead might maladaptively consolidate stressor information.\n",
      "To disentangle the role of spindles in declarative memory vs. anxiety regulation after stressor exposure, and to examine the role of PTSD in these processes, we measured nap sleep after a cohort of 45 trauma-exposed subjects were exposed to laboratory stress. Subjects (high vs. low in PTSD symptoms) performed two visits: 1) a stress visit involving exposure to negatively valent images pre-nap and 2) a control visit. In both visits, sleep was monitored via electroencephalography (EEG). A stressor recall session took place post-nap in the stress visit.\n",
      "NREM2 spindle rates were higher in stress vs. control sleep indicative of stress-induced changes in spindles. In high-PTSD subjects, NREM2 spindle rates in stress sleep predicted poorer recall accuracy of stressor images relative to low-PTSD subjects, while correlating with a greater reduction in stressor-induced anxiety levels post-sleep.\n",
      "Contrary to our expectations, although spindles are known to play a role in declarative memory processes, our findings highlight an important role for spindles in sleep-dependent anxiety regulation in PTSD.\n",

      "Effect of Disease Severity on Comorbid Conditions in Atopic Dermatitis: Nationwide Registry-Based Investigation in Finnish Adults.\n",
      "The majority of registry studies on atopic dermatitis include only patients and diagnoses from specialized healthcare. The aim of this retrospective, real-world cohort study was to evaluate the effect of atopic dermatitis severity on comorbidities and total morbidity, with comprehensive data from both primary and specialty healthcare registries covering the entire Finnish adult population. In total, 124,038 patients were identified (median age 46 years; 68% female) and stratified by disease severity. All regression analyses (median follow-up 7.0 years) were adjusted at a minimum for age, sex, obesity, and educational level. Compared with mild atopic dermatitis, severe atopic dermatitis was significantly associated with multiple morbidities, including neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders, abscesses, erysipelas/cellulitis, impetigo, herpes zoster, extragenital herpes, bacterial conjunctivitis, septicaemia, lymphomas, alopecia areata, urticaria, other dermatitis, contact allergy, osteoporosis, and intervertebral disc disorders (p < 0.001). In addition, there were significant associations with alcohol dependence, depression, condylomas, rosacea, migraine, sleep apnoea, hypertension, enthesopathies, atherosclerosis, and drug-induced cataract (p < 0.05). Odds ratios were modest and mostly were between 1.10 and 2.75. Furthermore, patients with severe atopic dermatitis had lower incidences of prostate cancer, cystitis, and anogenital herpes than patients with mild atopic dermatitis (p < 0.05). These results suggest that severe atopic dermatitis results in significant overall morbidity.\n",

      "Poor sleep quality during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions associated with reduced psychological wellbeing in healthcare students.\n",
      "Sleep is inexorably linked to both physiological and psychological wellbeing. Restrictions imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic likely impacted upon daily and weekly routines, which can have a negative impact on a range of factors including sleep quality, and/or quantity and general wellbeing. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of COVID-19 related restrictions on sleep patterns and psychological wellbeing of healthcare students. A survey was delivered to healthcare students across three faculties at a single institution. Participants completed questionnaires on the effect of COVID-19 restrictions on course delivery and clinical placements, its effect on sleep-wake times, sleep quality, sleep hygiene, psychological wellbeing, their current sleep knowledge and sleep education in their current course. Using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), over 75% of participants were found to have poor sleep quality. Changes in sleep habits and sleep behaviours during COVID-19 restrictions were associated with poorer sleep quality, and this poor sleep quality was associated with poor psychological wellbeing, particularly, motivation, stress and fatigue. Increases in negative sleep hygiene behaviours were associated with a statistically significant increase in PSQI global score. Positive emotions were positively correlated with PSQI (r = 0.22-0.24, \n",

      "The Impact of the Six Pillars of Lifestyle Medicine on Brain Health.\n",
      "Dementia is growing exponentially worldwide. Unfortunately, the treatment available does not reverse any type of cognitive impairment. As a result, healthcare professionals are focusing on other evidence-based options, such as lifestyle medicine (LM). Current evidence demonstrates improvement in neurocognitive decline by applying the six pillars of LM, which include plant-based nutrition, physical activity, stress management, avoidance of risky substances, restorative sleep, and social connections. Plant-based nutrition has a positive impact on cognition by decreasing the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) with high adherence to the Mediterranean-Dietary Approach to Systolic Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND). Physical activity also might prevent neurocognitive decline by increasing fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) and Irisin in the hippocampus, which increases energy expenditure and prolongs endurance. Additionally, higher perceived stress in adulthood and the use of risky substances such as alcohol, nicotine, and opioids are significantly associated with developing mild cognitive impairment and all-cause dementia. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between poor sleep and social isolation with a rapid progression in cognitive decline. Lifestyle changes have a substantial impact on brain health. Therefore, the focus should always be on prevention as the primary treatment tool.\n",

      "Thirty-seven thousand one hundred fifty students participated in the survey, including 48.4% female and 51.6% male. Online learning pressure was mainly recorded (65.1%). Many students suffered from sleeping disorders (56.2%). Some reported being victims of abuse (5.9%). Female students expressed a significantly higher level of distress than males, particularly the feeling of ambiguity about the purpose of life (p-value < 0.0001, OR: 0.94, 95% CI: [0.95-0.98]). Third-year students suffered higher stress levels than others, especially in online learning (68.8%, p-value < 0.05).

      "Mental and sexual health outcomes associated with FGM/C in Africa: a systematic narrative synthesis.\n",
      "There are gaps in evidence regarding mental and sexual outcomes and associated interventions for women with Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) living in Africa. This study employed a narrative synthesis to collate evidence on mental and sexual health outcomes. A systematic search of bibliographic databases and websites was performed using appropriate keywords and studies published in English from January 1, 2010 to March 25, 2022. 25 studies were retrieved and reported mental and sexual health complications associated with FGM/C. Most studies, n = 13 studies reported on sexual health outcomes including sexual pain, orgasm and sexual desire problems at sexual arousal and difficulties in lubrication. Mental health outcomes were reported in four studies including depression which was most prominent followed by somatisation and anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and sleep disorder. Studies did not highlight combined mental and sexual health interventions. The findings of this narrative synthesis reveal the need to prioritise provision of mental and sexual health care services for women with FGM/C. The study recommends strengthening of health systems in Africa through awareness building, training and capacity building of primary health and specialist health workers in offering mental and sexual health care to women with FGM/C.\n",

      "Revisiting Migraine: The Evolving Pathophysiology and the Expanding Management Armamentarium.\n",
      "Migraine affects about one billion people worldwide yearly and is one of the most common neurologic illnesses, with a high prevalence and morbidity, particularly among young adults and females. Migraine is associated with many comorbidities, including stress, sleep difficulties, and suicidal ideation. Migraine, despite its widespread occurrence, is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Because of the complicated and primarily unknown mechanisms of migraine formation, several social and biological risk factors, such as hormone imbalances, genetic and epigenetic impacts, and cardiovascular, neurological, and autoimmune illnesses, have been proposed. Through the mid-20th century diversion of the now-defunct vascular theory, the pathophysiology of migraine has developed from a historical study of the \"humours\" to a distinct entity as a neurological disorder. The range of therapeutic targets has broadened significantly, increasing the number of specialized clinical trials. Understanding the biology of migraine through careful research has resulted in the identification of major therapeutic classes: (i) triptans, serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists, (ii) gepants, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, (iii) ditans, 5-HT1F receptor agonists, (iv) CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and (v) glurants, mGlu5 modulators, with further targets being explored. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the most recent literature on epidemiology and risk factors and exposes knowledge gaps.\n",

      "A realist evaluation of the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial of a digital music and movement intervention for older people living in care homes.\n",
      "Low physical activity in care home residents brings about negative mental health consequences, such as higher levels of depression and loneliness. With advancements in communication technology, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the feasibility and effectiveness of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a digital Physical Activity (PA) resource in care homes deserve more research attention. A realist evaluation was used to uncover influencing factors of a feasibility study implementation to inform how a digital music and movement programme would work and under what circumstances this would be most effective.\n",
      "Participants were 49 older adults (aged 65 years +) recruited across ten care homes in Scotland. Surveys were administered at baseline and post-intervention comprising psychometric questionnaires on multidimensional health markers validated in older adults with possible cognitive impairment. The intervention comprised 12 weeks of four prescribed digitally delivered movement (n = 3) and music-only (n = 1) sessions per week. An activity coordinator delivered these online resources in the care home. Post-intervention focus groups with staff and interviews with a sub-sample of participants were conducted to gain qualitative data on the acceptability of the intervention.\n",
      "Thirty three care home residents started the intervention, but only 18 residents (84% female) completed both pre- and post-intervention assessments. Activity coordinators (AC) offered 57% of the prescribed sessions, with an average residents' adherence of 60%. Delivery of the intervention did not go as planned due to Covid restrictions in care homes and delivery challenges, including (1) motivation and engagement, (2) changes in cognitive impairment and disabilities of the participants, (3) death or hospitalisation of the participants and (4) limited staffing and technology resources to deliver the programme as intended. Despite this, group participation and encouragement of residents supported the delivery and acceptance of the intervention, with ACs and residents reporting improved mood, physical health, job satisfaction and social support. Improvements with large effect sizes were found for anxiety, depression, loneliness, perceived stress and sleep satisfaction, but no changes in fear of falling, domains of general health or appetite.\n",
      "This realist evaluation suggested that this digitally delivered movement and music intervention is feasible. From the findings, the initial programme theory was refined for future implementation of an RCT in other care homes but future research exploring how to tailor the intervention to those with cognitive impairment and/or lacking capacity to consent is needed.\n",

      "To examine the internal consistency reliability and measurement invariance of a questionnaire battery designed to identify college student athletes at risk for mental health symptoms and disorders.\n",
      "College student athletes (N=993) completed questionnaires assessing 13 mental health domains: strain, anxiety, depression, suicide and self-harm ideation, sleep, alcohol use, drug use, eating disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), gambling and psychosis. Internal consistency reliability of each measure was assessed and compared between sexes as well as to previous results in elite athletes. Discriminative ability analyses were used to examine how well the cut-off score on the strain measure (Athlete Psychological Strain Questionnaire) predicted cut-offs on other screening questionnaires.\n",
      "Strain, anxiety, depression, suicide and self-harm ideation, ADHD, PTSD and bipolar questionnaires all had acceptable or better internal consistency reliability. Sleep, gambling and psychosis questionnaires had questionable internal consistency reliability, although approaching acceptable for certain sex by measure values. The athlete disordered eating measure (Brief Eating Disorder in Athletes Questionnaire) had poor internal consistency reliability in males and questionable internal consistency reliability in females.\n",
      "The recommended mental health questionnaires were generally reliable for use with college student athletes. To truly determine the validity of the cut-off scores on these self-report questionnaires, future studies need to compare the questionnaires to a structured clinical interview to determine the discriminative abilities.\n",

      "Resilience as a moderator of role overload and sleep disturbance among caregivers of persons with dementia.\n",
      "The purpose of this study was to examine if resilience moderates the association between role overload and sleep disturbance among caregivers of persons with dementia. This was a secondary analysis of data on 437 informal caregivers (mean age=61.77 years, SD=13.69) of persons with dementia in the United States. Data from the 2017 wave of the National Study of Caregiving were analyzed using multiple regression with interaction terms to evaluate the moderation effect of resilience, while controlling for caregivers' age, race, gender, education, self-rated health, caregiving hours, and primary caregiving status. Higher role overload was associated with greater sleep disturbance and this association was attenuated among caregivers with higher levels of resilience. Our findings highlight the stress-buffering effects of resilience in the context of sleep disturbance in dementia caregivers. Interventions to improve caregivers' ability to recover, resist, and rebound during challenging situations may mitigate role overload and optimize sleep health.\n",

      "The Use of Evaluation Panels During the Development of a Digital Intervention for Veterans Based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia: Qualitative Evaluation Study.\n",
      "Individuals enrolling in the Veterans Health Administration frequently report symptoms consistent with insomnia disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a gold standard treatment for insomnia disorder. While the Veterans Health Administration has successfully implemented a large dissemination effort to train providers in CBT-I, the limited number of trained CBT-I providers continues to restrict the number of individuals who can receive CBT-I. Digital mental health intervention adaptations of CBT-I have been found to have similar efficacy as traditional CBT-I. To help address the unmet need for insomnia disorder treatment, the VA commissioned the creation of a freely available, internet-delivered digital mental health intervention adaptation of CBT-I known as Path to Better Sleep (PTBS).\n",
      "We aimed to describe the use of evaluation panels composed of veterans and spouses of veterans during the development of PTBS. Specifically, we report on the methods used to conduct the panels, the feedback they provided on elements of the course relevant to user engagement, and how their feedback influenced the design and content of PTBS.\n",
      "A communications firm was contracted to recruit 3 veteran (n=27) and 2 spouse of veteran (n=18) panels and convene them for three 1-hour meetings. Members of the VA team identified key questions for the panels, and the communications firm prepared facilitator guides to elicit feedback on these key questions. The guides provided a script for facilitators to follow while convening the panels. The panels were telephonically conducted, with visual content displayed via remote presentation software. The communications firm prepared reports summarizing the panelists' feedback during each panel meeting. The qualitative feedback described in these reports served as the raw material for this study.\n",
      "The panel members provided markedly consistent feedback on several elements of PTBS, including recommendations to emphasize the efficacy of CBT-I techniques; clarify and simplify written content as much as possible; and ensure that content is consistent with the lived experiences of veterans. Their feedback was congruent with previous studies on the factors influencing user engagement with digital mental health interventions. Panelist feedback influenced multiple course design decisions, including reducing the effort required to use the course's sleep diary function, making written content more concise, and selecting veteran testimonial videos that emphasized the benefits of treating chronic insomnia symptoms.\n",
      "The veteran and spouse evaluation panels provided useful feedback during the design of PTBS. This feedback was used to make concrete revisions and design decisions consistent with existing research on improving user engagement with digital mental health interventions. We believe that many of the key feedback messages provided by these evaluation panels could prove useful to other digital mental health intervention designers.\n",

      "From childhood trauma to hyperarousal in adults: The mediating effect of maladaptive shame coping and insomnia.\n",
      "A new line of insomnia research focuses on the developmental trajectories from early live stress to insomnia in adulthood. Adverse childhood experiences (ACE's) might create a vulnerability for later maladaptive coping with distress, as seen in chronic hyperarousal or insomnia. In an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, failure to dissociate the neurobiological components of shame from autobiographical shameful memories in insomnia was reflected by continued activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which may be a result of maladaptive coping in the wake of ACE's. Following up on that study, the current pilot study explores the relation between ACE's, shame coping-styles, adult insomnia, hyperarousal, and neurobiology of autobiographical memory.\n",
      "We used existing data (\n",
      "For the association between ACE's and hyperarousal, there was a significant mediation of shame-coping style (\n",
      "These findings could have an implication for the approach of treatment for insomnia. It could be focused more on trauma and emotional processing instead of conventional sleep interventions. Future studies are recommended to investigate the relationship mechanism between childhood trauma and insomnia, with additional factors of attachment styles, personality, and temperament.\n",

      "This study aimed to estimate depression, anxiety, stress, burnout, and sleep disturbances (insomnia and nightmares) among resident doctors after COVID-19 duty. The study was a prospective longitudinal study among resident doctors posted in COVID-19 wards in a tertiary hospital in North India.\n",
      "The participants were assessed at two points of time, two months apart, on a semistructured questionnaire and self-rated scales for depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, sleep quality, nightmare experience, and burnout.\n",
      "A significant proportion of resident doctors working in a COVID hospital had symptoms of depression (29.6%), anxiety (28.6%), stress (18.1%), insomnia (22%), and burnout (32.4%), even after two months of being off COVID duty. It was seen that these psychological outcomes had a strong positive correlation with each other. Compromised sleep quality and burnout significantly predicted depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia.\n",
      "The current study has added to the psychiatric aspects of COVID-19 among resident doctors and the changes in these symptoms with time and highlights the need for targeted interventions to decrease these adverse outcomes.\n",

      "The relationship between atopic dermatitis and atopic itch in children and the psychosocial functioning of their mothers: A cross-sectional study.\n",
      "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease significantly affecting patients' and their parents' lives. Mothers are mostly responsible for the long-term treatment and their wellbeing is essential. The major objective of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between atopic dermatitis in children, especially concomitant itch, and the quality of life, stress, sleep quality, anxiety, and depression of their mothers. The study included 88 mothers of children with atopic dermatitis and 52 mothers of children without atopic dermatitis. All mothers completed sociodemographic questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Athens Insomnia Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Additionally, mothers of children with atopic dermatitis filled in the Family Dermatology Life Quality Index. The severity of atopic dermatitis and pruritus intensity were evaluated by the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Index and the Numerical Rating Scale, respectively. The severity of atopic dermatitis and itch significantly correlated with the quality of life, insomnia, and perceived stress of the mothers. Mothers whose children had had atopic dermatitis for more than 6 months had significantly higher scores of anxiety and depression. The results highlight the importance of screening mothers for functional impairment to provide adequate support. More attention should be directed to the standardization of stepped care interventions addressing factors resulting in the impaired functioning of mothers.\n",

However, associations between PTSS and QOL at symptom level are not clear. This study examined the network structure of PTSS and its connection with QOL in psychiatric healthcare personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "This cross-sectional study was carried out between March 15 and March 20, 2020 based on convenience sampling. Self-report measures including the 17-item Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian version (PCL-C) and World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) were used to measure PTSS and global QOL, respectively. Network analysis was used to investigate the central symptoms of PTSS and pattern of connections between PTSS and QOL. An undirected network was constructed using an extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) model, while a directed network was established based on the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph (TMFG) method.\n",

      "Unlocking Modifiable Risk Factors for Alzheimer's Disease: Does the Oral Microbiome Hold Some of the Keys?\n",
      "Advancing age is recognized as the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however approximately one third of dementia cases are attributable to modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and obesity. Recent research also implicates oral health and the oral microbiome in AD risk and pathophysiology. The oral microbiome contributes to the cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative pathology of AD via the inflammatory, vascular, neurotoxic, and oxidative stress pathways of known modifiable risk factors. This review proposes a conceptual framework that integrates the emerging evidence regarding the oral microbiome with established modifiable risk factors. There are numerous mechanisms by which the oral microbiome may interact with AD pathophysiology. Microbiota have immunomodulatory functions, including the activation of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines. This inflammation can affect the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, which in turn modulates translocation of bacteria and their metabolites to brain parenchyma. Amyloid-β is an antimicrobial peptide, a feature which may in part explain its accumulation. There are microbial interactions with cardiovascular health, glucose tolerance, physical activity, and sleep, suggesting that these modifiable lifestyle risk factors of dementia may have microbial contributors. There is mounting evidence to suggest the relevance of oral health practices and the microbiome to AD. The conceptual framework presented here additionally demonstrates the potential for the oral microbiome to comprise a mechanistic intermediary between some lifestyle risk factors and AD pathophysiology. Future clinical studies may identify specific oral microbial targets and the optimum oral health practices to reduce dementia risk.\n",

The negative association between victimization and next-day school engagement was only significant when adolescents had shorter time in bed and longer latency than their typical levels that night, supporting the recovery role of sleep (ie, same-night sleep helps adolescents recover from victimization). There was also a significant interaction between previous-night time in bed and today's peer ethnic/racial victimization for same-day school engagement. The negative association between victimization and same-day school engagement was only significant when adolescents had shorter time in bed than their typical levels the previous night, supporting a preparatory hypothesis of sleep (ie, sleep helps prepare adolescents for next-day victimization).

      "mHealth interventions to reduce stress in healthcare workers (fitcor): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\n",
      "Causes and consequences of chronic stress levels in the context of healthcare work are well examined. Nevertheless, the implementation and evaluation of high-quality interventions to reduce stress of healthcare workers is still missing. Internet and app-based interventions are a promising venue for providing interventions for stress reduction to a population that is otherwise difficult to reach due to shift work and time constraints in general. To do so, we developed the internet and app-based intervention (fitcor), a digital coaching of individual stress coping for health care workers.\n",
      "We applied the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement as a guideline for the present protocol. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted. There are five different intervention groups and one waiting control group. To achieve the sample sizes required by power analysis (G*Power) (β-error 80%; effect size 0.25), the sample sizes of the respective scenarios will be at best as follows: 336 care workers from hospitals, 192 administrative health personnel, 145 care workers from stationary elderly care homes, and 145 care workers from ambulatory care providers in Germany. Participants will randomly be assigned to one of five different intervention groups. A crossover design with a waiting control group is planned. Interventions will be accompanied by three measurement points, first a baseline measure, second a post-intervention measure directly after completion of the intervention, and a follow-up measure 6 weeks after completion of the intervention. At all three measurement points, perceived team conflict, work-related experience patterns, personality, satisfaction with internet-based training, and back pain will be assessed using questionnaires, as well as heart rate variability, sleep quality, and daily movement will be recorded using an advanced sensor.\n",
      "Workers in the health care sector increasingly face high job demands and stress levels. Traditional health interventions fail to reach the respective population due to organizational constraints. Implementation of digital health interventions has been found to improve stress coping behavior; however, the evidence in health care settings has not been established. To the best of our knowledge, fitcor is the first internet and app-based intervention to reduce stress among nursing and administrative health care personnel.\n",

      "Metabotropic glutamate receptor function and regulation of sleep-wake cycles.\n",
      "Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors are the most abundant family of G-protein coupled receptors and are widely expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Alterations in glutamate homeostasis, including dysregulations in mGlu receptor function, have been indicated as key contributors to multiple CNS disorders. Fluctuations in mGlu receptor expression and function also occur across diurnal sleep-wake cycles. Sleep disturbances including insomnia are frequently comorbid with neuropsychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative conditions. These often precede behavioral symptoms and/or correlate with symptom severity and relapse. Chronic sleep disturbances may also be a consequence of primary symptom progression and can exacerbate neurodegeneration in disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, there is a bidirectional relationship between sleep disturbances and CNS disorders; disrupted sleep may serve as both a cause and a consequence of the disorder. Importantly, comorbid sleep disturbances are rarely a direct target of primary pharmacological treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders even though improving sleep can positively impact other symptom clusters. This chapter details known roles of mGlu receptor subtypes in both sleep-wake regulation and CNS disorders focusing on schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, AD, and substance use disorder (cocaine and opioid). In this chapter, preclinical electrophysiological, genetic, and pharmacological studies are described, and, when possible, human genetic, imaging, and post-mortem studies are also discussed. In addition to reviewing the important relationships between sleep, mGlu receptors, and CNS disorders, this chapter highlights the development of selective mGlu receptor ligands that hold promise for improving both primary symptoms and sleep disturbances.\n",

      "Astrocyte-neuron circuits in epilepsy.\n",
      "The epilepsies are a diverse spectrum of disease states characterized by spontaneous seizures and associated comorbidities. Neuron-focused perspectives have yielded an array of widely used anti-seizure medications and are able to explain some, but not all, of the imbalance of excitation and inhibition which manifests itself as spontaneous seizures. Furthermore, the rate of pharmacoresistant epilepsy remains high despite the regular approval of novel anti-seizure medications. Gaining a more complete understanding of the processes that turn a healthy brain into an epileptic brain (epileptogenesis) as well as the processes which generate individual seizures (ictogenesis) may necessitate broadening our focus to other cell types. As will be detailed in this review, astrocytes augment neuronal activity at the level of individual neurons in the form of gliotransmission and the tripartite synapse. Under normal conditions, astrocytes are essential to the maintenance of blood-brain barrier integrity and remediation of inflammation and oxidative stress, but in epilepsy these functions are impaired. Epilepsy results in disruptions in the way astrocytes relate to each other by gap junctions which has important implications for ion and water homeostasis. In their activated state, astrocytes contribute to imbalances in neuronal excitability due to their decreased capacity to take up and metabolize glutamate and an increased capacity to metabolize adenosine. Furthermore, due to their increased adenosine metabolism, activated astrocytes may contribute to DNA hypermethylation and other epigenetic changes that underly epileptogenesis. Lastly, we will explore the potential explanatory power of these changes in astrocyte function in detail in the specific context of the comorbid occurrence of epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease and the disruption in sleep-wake regulation associated with both conditions.\n",

      "Frontline Healthcare provider (HCP) burnout has dramatically increased due to the COVID 19 pandemic. Hospitals are supporting wellness programs and techniques to reduce burnout including the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique. This study evaluated the use of TM on HCP symptoms of stress, burnout and wellness.\n",
      "A total of 65 HCPs at three South Florida hospitals were recruited and instructed in the TM technique which they practiced at home for 20 minutes twice a day. A parallel lifestyle as usual control group was enrolled. Validated measurement scales (Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey [MBI-HSS (MP)] and the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale (WEMWBS) were administered at baseline, 2 weeks, one and three months.\n",
      "No significant demographic differences were seen between the 2 groups; however, some baseline scales were higher in the TM group. TM average weekly session completion rate was very high at 83%. After 2-weeks, symptoms of somatization, depression, and anxiety in the TM group had all shown near 45% reductions, while insomnia, emotional exhaustion, and well-being had improved by 33%, 16%, and 11% respectively (P = 0.02 for somatization and < .001 for all others); no significant change was noted in the LAU group. At 3-months, in the TM group, the improvement in symptoms showed a mean reduction of in anxiety, 62%, somatization, 58%, depression, 50%, insomnia, 44%, emotional exhaustion 40%, depersonalization, 42%, and improvement of well-being 18% (for all p<0.004). P-values for between-group differences in change from baseline, based upon repeated measures ANCOVA covarying for baseline measurements, showed significance for all scales at 3-months.\n",
      "The study confirmed the reported significant and rapid benefits of the practice of TM and demonstrated its positive psychological impact on healthcare workers in a high stress setting.\n",

      "Anxiety in pregnancy and stress responsiveness: An exploratory study of heart rate variability, cortisol, and alpha-amylase in the third trimester.\n",
      "The present study aimed to explore the association between anxiety symptoms, including sleep, and physiological stress responsiveness in pregnant women with and without anxiety, as identified by psychiatric diagnosis. Fifty-four pregnant women with (n = 25) and without (n = 29) anxiety completed a laboratory cognitive stressor (the Stroop Color-Word Task) during the third trimester. Heart rate variability (HRV) (as the root mean square of successive differences, RMSSD) was recorded during baseline, stressor, and recovery periods. Salivary cortisol (sCORT) and alpha amylase (sAA) were measured at four timepoints surrounding the stressor task. Psychometric scales (Penn State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ], Perceived Stress Scale [PSS], Spielberg Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale [STAI], and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) were collected. Women in the anxiety group exhibited significantly less rebound in HRV (RMSSD, change of 4-ms difference, p = .025) from baseline to recovery following the Stroop than did those in the non-anxiety group. Neither neuroendocrine measure (sCORT, sAA) differed between groups at any measurement period. Across the recording period, lower reported sleep quality (PSQI, p = .0092) and higher subjective stress (PSS, p = .039) were associated with lower RMSSD. The findings suggest that women with and without anxiety in late pregnancy display differences in the degree of autonomic rebound as indicated by HRV following a stressor. In addition, levels of HRV over time were associated with subjective perceptions of increased stress and poor sleep.

      "An intergenerational life-course approach to address early childhood obesity and adiposity: the Healthy Life Trajectories Initiative (HeLTI).\n",
      "Interactions between genes and early-life exposures during conception, fetal life, infancy, and early childhood have been shown to affect an individual's health later in life. Maternal undernutrition and obesity, gestational diabetes, and impaired growth in utero and in early life are associated with adiposity and overweight and obesity in childhood, which are risk factors for poor health trajectories and non-communicable diseases. In Canada, China, India, and South Africa, 10-30% of children aged 5-16 years are overweight or obese.\n",
      "The application of developmental origins of health and disease principles offers a novel approach to prevention of overweight and obesity and reduction of adiposity by delivering integrated interventions across the life course, starting before conception and continuing through early childhood. The Healthy Life Trajectories Initiative (HeLTI) was established in 2017 through a unique collaboration between national funding agencies in Canada, China, India, South Africa, and WHO. The aim of HeLTI is to evaluate the effect of an integrated four-phase intervention starting preconceptionally and continuing through pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood on reducing childhood adiposity (fat mass index) and overweight and obesity, and optimising early child development, nutrition, and other healthy behaviours.\n",
      "Approximately 22 000 women are being recruited in Shanghai (China), Mysore (India), Soweto (South Africa), and across various provinces of Canada. Women who conceive (an expected 10 000) and their children will be followed up until the child reaches the age of 5 years.\n",
      "HeLTI has harmonised the intervention, measures, tools, biospecimen collection, and analysis plans for the trial to be run across four countries. HeLTI will help establish whether an intervention aimed at addressing maternal health behaviours, nutrition, and weight; providing psychosocial support to reduce maternal stress and prevent mental illness; optimising infant nutrition, physical activity, and sleep; and promoting parenting skills can reduce the intergenerational risk of excess childhood adiposity and overweight and obesity across diverse settings.\n",

      "Potential effects of shift work on skin autoimmune diseases.\n",
      "Shift work is associated with systemic chronic inflammation, impaired host and tumor defense and dysregulated immune responses to harmless antigens such as allergens or auto-antigens. Thus, shift workers are at higher risk to develop a systemic autoimmune disease and circadian disruption with sleep impairment seem to be the key underlying mechanisms. Presumably, disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle also drive skin-specific autoimmune diseases, but epidemiological and experimental evidence so far is scarce. This review summarizes the effects of shift work, circadian misalignment, poor sleep, and the effect of potential hormonal mediators such as stress mediators or melatonin on skin barrier functions and on innate and adaptive skin immunity. Human studies as well as animal models were considered. We will also address advantages and potential pitfalls in animal models of shift work, and possible confounders that could drive skin autoimmune diseases in shift workers such as adverse lifestyle habits and psychosocial influences. Finally, we will outline feasible countermeasures that may reduce the risk of systemic and skin autoimmunity in shift workers, as well as treatment options and highlight outstanding questions that should be addressed in future studies.\n",

      "Prevalence and management of sleep disturbance in adults with primary brain tumours and their caregivers: a systematic review.\n",
      "The aims of this systematic review were to (1) examine the prevalence, severity, manifestations, and clinical associations/risk factors of sleep disturbance in primary brain tumour (PBT) survivors and their caregivers; and (2) determine whether there are any sleep-focused interventons reported in the literature pertaining to people affected by PBT.\n",
      "This systematic review was registered with the international register for systematic reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42022299332). PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, PsychINFO, and CINAHL were electronically searched for relevant articles reporting sleep disturbance and/or interventions for managing sleep disturbance published between September 2015 and May 2022. The search strategy included terms focusing on sleep disturbance, primary brain tumours, caregivers of PBT survivors, and interventions. Two reviewers conducted the quality appraisal (JBI Critical Appraisal Tools) independently, with results compared upon completion.\n",
      "34 manuscripts were eligible for inclusion. Sleep disturbance was highly prevalent in PBT survivors with associations between sleep disturbance and some treatments (e.g., surgical resection, radiotherapy, corticosteroid use), as well as other prevalent symptoms (e.g., fatigue, drowsiness, stress, pain). While the current review was unable to find any sleep-targeted interventions, preliminary evidence suggests physical activity may elicit beneficial change on subjectively reported sleep disturbance in PBT survivors. Only one manuscript that discussed caregivers sleep disturbance was identified.\n",
      "Sleep disturbance is a prevalent symptom experienced by PBT survivors, yet there is a distinct lack of sleep-focused interventions in this population. This includes a need for future research to include caregivers, with only one study identified. Future research exploring interventions directly focused on the management of sleep disturbance in the context of PBT is warranted.\n",

      "Administration of growth hormone ameliorates adverse effects of total sleep deprivation.\n",
      "Total sleep deprivation (TSD) causes several harmful changes including anxiety, inflammation, and increased expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) genes in the hippocampus. The current study was conducted to explain the possible effects of exogenous GH against the above parameters caused by TSD and the possible mechanisms involved. Male Wistar rats were divided into 1) control, 2) TSD and 3) TSD + GH groups. To induce TSD, the rats received a mild repetitive electric shock (2 mA, 3 s) to their paws every 10 min for 21 days. Rats in the third group received GH (1 ml/kg, sc) for 21 days as treatment for TSD. The motor coordination, locomotion, the level of IL-6, and expression of ERK and TrkB genes in hippocampal tissue were measured after TSD. The motor coordination (p < 0.001) and locomotion indices (p < 0.001) were impaired significantly by TSD. The concentrations of serum corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) (p < 0.001) and hippocampal interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p < 0.001) increased. However, there was a significant decrease in the interleukin-4 (IL-4) concentration and expression of ERK (p < 0.001) and TrkB (p < 0.001) genes in the hippocampus of rats with TSD. Treatment of TSD rats with GH improved motor balance (p < 0.001) and locomotion (p < 0.001), decreased serum CRH (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p < 0.01) but increased the IL-4 and expression of ERK (p < 0.001) and TrkB (p < 0.001) genes in the hippocampus. Results show that GH plays a key role in modulating the stress hormone, inflammation, and the expression of ERK and TrkB genes in the hippocampus following stress during TSD.\n",

      "Evaluation of Thiol-Disulfide Homeostasis with Electrical Status Epilepticus in Slow Sleep (ESES).\n",
      "Electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) is an epileptic syndrome specific to childhood and has a broad clinical spectrum that included seizures, behavioral/cognitive impairments, and motor neurological symptoms. Antioxidants are seen as promising neuroprotective strategies for the epileptic state by combating the harmful effects of excessive oxidant formation in mitochondria.\n",
      "This study aims to evaluate the thiol-disulfide balance and to determine whether it can be used in the clinical and electrophysiological follow-up of patients with ESES, especially in addition to the electroencephalography (EEG) examination.\n",
      "The study included 30 patients, aged 2-18 years and diagnosed with ESES in the Pediatric Neurology Clinic of the Training and Research Hospital and a control group of 30 healthy children. Total thiol, native thiol, disulfide, and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels were measured, and disulfide-thiol ratios were calculated for both groups.\n",
      "Native thiol and total thiol levels were significantly lower and IMA level and disulfide-native thiol percentage ratio were significantly higher in the ESES patient group than in the control group.\n",
      "Serum thiol-disulfide homeostasis is an accurate marker of oxidative stress in ESES, and standard and automated measures of thiol-disulfide balance as an indicator of oxidative stress showed a shift toward oxidation in ESES patients in this study. The negative correlation between spike-wave index (SWI) and thiol levels, and serum thiol-disulfide levels suggest that they can be used as biomarkers for follow-up of patients with ESES in addition to EEG. IMA can also be used for long-term response to monitoring purposes at ESES.\n",

      "To explore potential relationships and longitudinal changes in sleep and mental health in recruit paramedics over the first 6-months of work, and whether sleep disturbances pre-emergency work predict future mental health outcomes.\n",
      "Participants (N=101, 52% female, Mage=26 years) completed questionnaires prior to (baseline), and after 6 months of emergency work to assess for symptoms of insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and trauma exposure. At each timepoint, participants also completed a sleep diary and wore an actigraph for 14 days to assess sleep patterns. Correlations between baseline sleep and mental health were conducted and changes in these variables across timepoints were examined using linear mixed models. Hierarchical regressions assessed whether sleep at baseline predicted mental health at follow-up.\n",
      "Insomnia and depression symptoms, and total sleep time increased while sleep onset latency decreased across the first 6 months of emergency work. Participants experienced an average of 1 potentially traumatic event during the 6-month period. Baseline insomnia predicted increased depression symptoms at the 6-month follow-up, while baseline wake after sleep onset predicted follow-up PTSD symptoms.\n",
      "Results highlight an increase in insomnia and depression across the initial months of emergency work, while sleep disturbances before emergency work were identified as potential risk factors for the development of depression and PTSD among paramedics in their early career. Screening and early interventions targeting poor sleep at the beginning of emergency employment may assist in reducing the risk of future mental health outcomes in this high-risk occupation.\n",

      "Sleep spindles are a signature feature of non-REM (NREM) sleep, with demonstrated relationships to sleep maintenance and learning and memory. Because PTSD is characterized by disturbances in sleep maintenance and in stress learning and memory, there is now a growing interest in examining the role of sleep spindles in the neurobiology of PTSD. This review provides an overview of methods for measuring and detecting sleep spindles as they pertain to human PTSD and stress research, presents a critical review of early findings examining sleep spindles in PTSD and stress neurobiology, and proposes several directions for future research. In doing so, this review underscores the extensive heterogeneity in sleep spindle measurement and detection methods, the wide range of spindle features that may be and have been examined, the many persisting unknowns about the clinical and functional relevance of those features, and the problems considering PTSD as a homogeneous group in between-group comparisons. This review also highlights the progress that has been made in this field and underscores the strong rationale for ongoing work in this area.\n",

By comparing migraine (side, location, aggravated by routine physical activity, NRS score, frequency, accompanying symptoms, with premonitory symptom (PS) and trigger, sum of PS and trigger) and migraine-related factors [chronic daily headache, medicine overused headache, body mass index (BMI), education level, exercise status, sleep status, consumption of tea/coffee/alcohol, patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score and generalized anxiety disorder-7, (GAD-7) score)] among groups, it was found that the J1 group and the J2 group presented more typical migraine features than the J3 group; 2) the J3 group was more prone to emotion and sleep disorders, weight management issues, frequent migraine attacks and medication overuse. This study provided a basis for further dividing MWA. Genetic research should be conducted and treatment should be prescribed accordingly because the underlying pathogenesis may be different.\n",

      "This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of an online CBT intervention with limited therapist contact targeting a range of posttraumatic symptoms among evacuees from the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfires. One hundred and thirty-six residents of Fort McMurray who reported either moderate PTSD symptoms (PCL-5 ≥ 23) or mild PTSD symptoms (PCL-5 ≥ 10) with moderate depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) or subthreshold insomnia symptoms (ISI ≥ 8) were randomized either to a treatment (n = 69) or a waitlist condition (n = 67). Participants were on average 45 years old, and mostly identified as White (82%) and as women (76%). Primary outcomes were PTSD, depression, and insomnia symptoms. Secondary outcomes were anxiety symptoms and disability. Significant Assessment Time × Treatment Condition interactions were observed on all outcomes, indicating that access to the treatment led to a decrease in posttraumatic stress (F[1,117.04] = 12.128, p = .001; d = .519, 95% CI = .142-.895), depression (F[1,118.29] = 9.978, p = .002; d = .519, 95% CI = .141-.898) insomnia (F[1,117.60] = 4.574, p = .035; d = .512, 95% CI = .132-.892), and anxiety (F[1,119.64] = 5.465, p = .021; d = .421, 95% CI = .044-.797) symptom severity and disability (F[1,111.55] = 7.015, p = .009; d = .582, 95% CI = .200-.963). Larger effect sizes (d = 0.823-1.075) were observed in participants who completed at least half of the treatment.

      "Too loud to handle?: transportation noise and cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "The WHO reports that more than 1.6 million healthy life-years are lost yearly from traffic-related noise in Western Europe. In addition, the number of studies reporting health side effects in response to traffic noise is steadily growing, mainly cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as acute and chronic ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, and stroke. Pathophysiologically nighttime noise has been shown to cause sleep disturbances, including too short sleep periods and frequent interruption of sleep leading to an increase in the levels of circulating stress hormones and subsequently to a significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS; =oxidative stress) and inflammation in the vasculature and the brain. The consequence is arterial hypertension and vascular (endothelial) dysfunction, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. With the present review, we will give an overview of the \"so-called\" non-auditory cardiovascular health effects of noise, which have been proposed to be responsible for the future development of CVD. We will present epidemiological evidence but also evidence provided by translational human and experimental noise studies. Finally, we will discuss maneuvers to mitigate noise effectively.\n",

We hypothesized that chronic sleep restriction (SR) alters the HPA axis diurnal rhythm and the sexually dimorphic response to acute stressor during opioid abstinence. We developed a rat model to evaluate the effect of persistent sleep loss during opioid abstinence on HPA axis dynamics in male and female rats. Plasma ACTH and corticosterone were measured diurnally and in response to acute restraint stress in rats Before (control) compared to During subsequent opioid abstinence without or with SR. Abstinence, regardless of sleep state, led to an increase in plasma ACTH and corticosterone in the morning in males. There was a tendency for higher PM plasma ACTH during abstinence in SR males (\n",

      "Changes in menstrual cycle length and in sleep-wake behaviors during COVID-19 related lockdown in Israel.\n",
      "COVID-19 related lockdowns changed our life. Studies report that young women are more susceptible to lockdown-induced adverse effects and stress. As stress and menstrual cycle are associated, we hypothesized that menstrual cycle length might change during lockdown. We examined menstrual cycle length, and sleep-wake behaviors during lockdown in Israel. Participants were 97 women in their fertile years who used Tempdrop fertility sensor™ to track cycles. Data were collected before, during and after lockdown in Israel. Our main finding is that lockdown was associated with changes in menstrual cycle length of most participants, with either increased of decreased length. Changes were reversed when lockdown was terminated. Sleep duration increased during lockdown but we found no relationship between sleep and menstrual cycle. We suggest these findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between stress, sleep, and menstrual cycle. Further studies should explore the sources for differential effects in sub-groups of women.\n",

      "Clinical correlates and prognostic implications of severe suicidal ideation in major depressive disorder.\n",
      "Suicidal ideation (SI) is a risk factor for suicidal behaviour. To ascertain the clinical correlates and prognostic impact of severe SI, we analysed 249 outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidal thoughts included in the COmbining Medications to Enhance Depression outcome (CO-MED) trial. Patients with severe SI (36%) were younger at disease onset (P = 0.0033), more severely depressed (P = 0.0029), had more lifetime suicidal behaviour (P < 0.0001) and psychiatric comorbidities (panic disorder: P = 0.0025; post-traumatic stress disorder: P = 0.0216), and a history of childhood maltreatment (neglect: P = 0.0054; emotional abuse: P = 0.0230; physical abuse: P = 0.0076; sexual abuse: P = 0.0016) than those experiencing low-moderate SI. After controlling for depression score, severe SI was positively correlated with lifetime suicidal behaviour (OR [95% CI]: 1.26 [1.12-1.41]), panic disorder (1.05 [1.00-1.12]), and childhood maltreatment (neglect: 1.93 [1.13-3.30]; physical abuse: 2.00 [1.11-3.69]; sexual abuse: 2.13 [1.17-3.88]), and inversely correlated with age of onset (0.97 [0.95-0.99]) and sleep-onset insomnia (0.76 [0.61-0.96]). Finally, the occurrence of serious lifetime suicidal behaviour was predicted by SI severity (2.18 [1.11-4.27]), bipolar score (1.36 [1.02-1.81]), and childhood sexual abuse (2.35 [1.09-5.05]). These results emphasise the importance of assessing childhood maltreatment and bipolar liability in MDD to estimate suicidal behaviour risk.\n",

      "This prespecified secondary analysis reports the 6-month outcomes of the multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled VICTAS randomized clinical trial, which was conducted between August 2018 and July 2019. Adult patients with sepsis-induced respiratory and/or cardiovascular dysfunction who survived to discharge or day 30 were recruited from 43 intensive care units in the US. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either the intervention or control group. Cognitive, psychological, and functional outcomes at 6 months after randomization were assessed via telephone through January 2020. Data analyses were conducted between February 2021 and December 2022.\n",
      "The intervention group received intravenous vitamin C (1.5 g), thiamine hydrochloride (100 mg), and hydrocortisone sodium succinate (50 mg) every 6 hours for 96 hours or until death or intensive care unit discharge. The control group received matching placebo.\n",

      "Every Mind Matters (EMM) is a publicly funded health campaign, launched in England in 2019, to equip adults to look after their mental health, and that of others, by offering online information about common problems: anxiety, low mood, sleep, and stress. This study is one component of an independent evaluation of EMM conducted by the NIHR Mental Health Policy Research Unit. Its aim is to explore individuals' experiences of the EMM campaign and website.\n",
      "Four researchers, including three with lived experience of using mental health services, conducted 20, one-off, semi-structured, online interviews with a range of adult participants, including a sample of EMM users and a purposively recruited sub-sample known to have severe or long-term mental health conditions. A codebook thematic analysis was undertaken, and four main themes were identified.\n",
      "There was an expectation from the name Every Mind Matters that its advice would address everyone. Almost all participants had experience of mental distress and looked to EMM for help with a current problem for themselves. All participants were complimentary about the EMM website and found it to be user-friendly (theme 1) and personalised (theme 2) especially the interactive feature Your Mind Plan quiz which responds with suggested actions to improve wellbeing and follows up with reminder emails. A few participants found the website information and/or Mind Plan suggestions to be life changing. Some participants wanted EMM to better acknowledge the contexts in which they live (theme 3) such as the limitations of health conditions and health services, and difficulties of crowded housing, social policy, and climate change. Many participants would like EMM to do more (theme 4), offer more interactivity, more choice, more information about available treatments, and more stratified advice to cover more severe mental health conditions.\n",
      "EMM is available to all, including people with common or severe mental disorders. In the context of overwhelmed mental health services, people with severe mental illness expect more from EMM than advice about common problems. EMM could build on its success by extending its remit to address a wider range of needs so that everyone is included.\n",

      "A systematic review of acculturation and sleep health among adult immigrants in the United States.\n",
      "The United States (US) has more immigrants than any other country in the world, with an estimated 44 million non-US-born individuals residing in the country as of 2018. Previous studies have linked US acculturation to both positive and negative health outcomes, including sleep. However, the relationship between US acculturation and sleep health is not well understood. This systematic review aims to identify and synthesize scientific studies on acculturation and sleep health among adult immigrants in the US. A systematic search of the literature was performed in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science in 2021 and 2022 with no date limiters. Quantitative studies published anytime in a peer-reviewed journal in English among an adult immigrant population with an explicit measure of acculturation and a sleep health dimension, sleep disorder, or daytime sleepiness measure were considered for inclusion. The initial literature search yielded 804 articles for review; after removing duplicates, applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, and searching reference lists, 38 total articles were included. We found consistent evidence that acculturative stress was associated with worse sleep quality/continuity, daytime sleepiness, and sleep disorders. However, we discovered limited consensus on the association of acculturation scales and acculturation proxy measures with sleep. Our review demonstrated that compared to US-born adult populations, there is a high prevalence of adverse sleep health among immigrant populations, and acculturation likely plays an important role in shaping this disparity, particularly through acculturative stress.\n",

Self-reported current and pre-pandemic weight, physical activity, smoking status, perceived eating habits, alcohol intake and sleep quality were collected by online questionnaires. Based on these 6 indicator variables, latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify lifestyle behaviour change patterns. Associations with potential risk factors including age, gender, ethnicity, education, income, chronic diseases, body image perception, and changes in stress level, living situation and work arrangement were examined with logistic regressions.\n",
      "Participants' mean BMI was 26.1 ± 6.3 kg/m2; 60.9% had >= bachelor's degree. Since the pandemic, 35% had decreased income and 49% changed work arrangement. Most participants reported unchanged weight, sleep quality, physical activity level, smoking and alcohol consumption, yet 44% reported a perceived decrease in eating habits quality. From LCA, 2 classes of lifestyle behaviour change emerged; \"healthy\" and \"less healthy\" (probability: 0.605 and 0.395; BIC=15574.3, entropy=4.8). \"Healthy\" class participants more frequently reported unchanged weight, sleep quality, smoking and alcohol intake, unchanged/improved eating habits and increased physical activity. The \"less healthy\" class reported significant weight gain, deteriorated eating habits and sleep quality, unchanged/increased alcohol intake and smoking, and decreased physical activity. Among risk factors, body image dissatisfaction OR=8.8, 95%CI (5.3-14.7), depression OR=1.8, 95%CI (1.3, 2.5), increased stress level OR=3.4, 95%CI (2.0, 5.8) and of gender minority identity OR=5.5, 95% CI (1.3-22.3) were associated with adopting \"less healthy\" behaviours in adjusted models.\n",

      "The use and acceptance of medicinal cannabis is on the rise across the globe. To support the interests of public health, evidence relating to its use, effects, and safety is required to match this community demand. Web-based user-generated data are often used by researchers and public health organizations for the investigation of consumer perceptions, market forces, population behaviors, and for pharmacoepidemiology.\n",
      "In this review, we aimed to summarize the findings of studies that have used user-generated text as a data source to study medicinal cannabis or the use of cannabis as medicine. Our objectives were to categorize the insights provided by social media research on cannabis as medicine and describe the role of social media for consumers using medicinal cannabis.\n",
      "The inclusion criteria for this review were primary research studies and reviews that reported on the analysis of web-based user-generated content on cannabis as medicine. The MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched from January 1974 to April 2022.\n",
      "We examined 42 studies published in English and found that consumers value their ability to exchange experiences on the web and tend to rely on web-based information sources. Cannabis discussions have portrayed the substance as a safe and natural medicine to help with many health conditions including cancer, sleep disorders, chronic pain, opioid use disorders, headaches, asthma, bowel disease, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. These discussions provide a rich resource for researchers to investigate medicinal cannabis-related consumer sentiment and experiences, including the opportunity to monitor cannabis effects and adverse events, given the anecdotal and often biased nature of the information is properly accounted for.\n",
      "The extensive web-based presence of the cannabis industry coupled with the conversational nature of social media discourse results in rich but potentially biased information that is often not well-supported by scientific evidence. This review summarizes what social media is saying about the medicinal use of cannabis and discusses the challenges faced by health governance agencies and professionals to make use of web-based resources to both learn from medicinal cannabis users and provide factual, timely, and reliable evidence-based health information to consumers.\n",

A high level of psychological resilience can help them to maintain a positive attitude and cope with stressful events. However, few studies were conducted to investigate the effects of psychological resilience buffering cell phone addiction on sleep quality. In our hypothesis, psychological toughness would mitigate the worsening impact of cell phone addiction on sleep quality.\n",

      "Automated Sleep Deprivation Setup Using a Shaking Platform in Mice.\n",
      "The functions of sleep remain largely unclear, and even less is known about its role in development. A general strategy to tackle these questions is to disrupt sleep and measure the outcomes. However, some existing sleep deprivation methods may not be suitable for studying the effects of chronic sleep disruption, due to their lack of effectiveness and/or robustness, substantial stress caused by the deprivation method, or consuming a large quantity of time and manpower. More problems may be encountered when applying these existing protocols to young, developing animals, because of their likely heightened vulnerability to stressors, and difficulties in precisely monitoring sleep at young ages. Here, we report a protocol of automated sleep disruption in mice using a commercially available, shaking platform-based deprivation system. We show that this protocol effectively and robustly deprives both non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep without causing a significant stress response, and does not require human supervision. This protocol uses adolescent mice, but the method also works with adult mice. Graphical abstract \n",

Most participants reported moderate or high MTQS (57%) and were interested in receiving free cessation treatment (51%). Participants most frequently selected the following options as among the top 3 treatments that offered the best chance of quitting: Nicotine replacement therapy (25%), money/gift cards for quitting (17%), prescription medications (17%), and switching to e-cigarettes (16%). Craving (55%), stress/mood (40%), habit (39%), and being around other smokers (36%) were frequently identified as the most challenging aspects of quitting. Low MTQS was associated with White race, lack of religious participation, lack of health insurance, lower income, greater cigarettes smoked per day, and higher expired carbon monoxide. Higher MTQS was associated with sleeping unsheltered, cell phone ownership, higher health literacy, more years of smoking, and interest in free treatment.\n",

      "Use of a physical activity monitor to track perioperative activity of radical cystectomy patients our first glimpse at what our patients are doing before and after surgery.\n",
      "To optimize recovery after radical cystectomy (RC), providers stress the importance of ambulation and adequate rest. However, little is known about the activity and sleep habits of patients undergoing RC. Therefore, we utilized a wearable physical activity monitor (PAM) in the perioperative period to provide the first objective data on physical activity and sleep habits for RC patients.\n",
      "We prospectively identified patients ≥60 years old with planned RC. Participants completed a 4-week prehabilitation exercise program prior to surgery. They wore a PAM for 7-day intervals: at baseline, after prehabilitation, at postoperative day (POD) 30 and POD90. We tracked physical activity via metabolic equivalents (METs). METs were categorized by intensity: light (MET 1.5-<3), moderate (MET 3-<6), and vigorous (MET ≥6). We calculated daily step totals. We tracked hours slept and number of sleep awakenings. We correlated activity and sleep with self-reported quality of life (QOL).\n",
      "Forty-two patients completed prehabilitation and RC. Moderate intensity exercise decreased at POD30 (61 minutes/d at baseline, 30 minutes/d at POD30, P = 0.005). Physical activity did not significantly differ for light or vigorous activity at any timepoint. RC did not significantly affect sleep. Sleep and physical activity were associated with mental and physical QOL, respectively.\n",
      "This is the first study utilizing patient-worn monitors in RC to track physical activity and sleep. This study gives patients and providers a better understanding of postcystectomy recovery expectations. With these results in mind, interventions may be implemented to optimize activity and sleep in the perioperative period.\n",

      "Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) are potentially lethal infections marked by local tissue destruction and systemic sepsis, which require aggressive treatment. Survivors often face a long recovery trajectory. This study was initiated to increase understanding of the long-term impact of NSTI on health related quality of life (HRQoL), and how care may be improved.\n",
      "Thematic analysis was applied to qualitative data from 25 NSTI-survivors obtained through two focus groups (n = 14) and semi-structured interviews (n = 11).\n",
      "The median age of the participants was 49 years, 14 were female. The median time since diagnosis was 5 years. Initial misdiagnosis was common, causing delay to treatment. Survivors experienced long-term physical consequences (scarring, cognitive impairment, fatigue, sleeping problems, recurrent infections), psychological consequences (traumatic stress symptoms, fear of relapse, adjusting to an altered appearance, sexual issues) and social and relational consequences (changes in social contacts, a lack of understanding). The disease also had a major psychological impact on family members, as well as major financial impact in some. There was a strong desire to reflect on 'mistakes' in case of initial misdiagnosis. To improve care, patient and family centered care, smooth transitions after discharge, and the availability of understandable information were deemed important.\n",
      "This study reveals that NSTI have a large impact on physical and psychosocial wellbeing of survivors and their relatives. Except for a few differences (misdiagnosis, fear for re-infection and actual re-infection), the patient experience of patients with NSTI is largely similar to those of burn survivors. Thus, questionnaires to assess HRQoL in burn survivors may be used in future NSTI studies.\n",

      "Subjective perceived risk factors of exertional heat exhaustion-related symptoms in male collegiate athletes in Japan: a case-control study.\n",
      "The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between lifestyle habits, health factors, athletic activity conditions, and exertional heat exhaustion (EHE)-related symptoms among male college athletes in Japan based on a self-completed questionnaire. The paper-based questionnaires were distributed to 11 universities in Japan, and 2006 respondents completed the survey. Data of personal characteristics (age, body mass), lifestyle habits (sleep duration, use of air-conditioner while sleeping, and practice duration), perceived health factors (loss of appetite, sleep deprivation, sickness, dehydration, accumulated fatigue, and mental stress), perceived athletic activity (insufficient rest breaks, high ambient temperature, excessive humidity, strong solar radiation, lack of ambient wind, and clothing discomfort), and EHE-related symptoms (dizziness, headaches, nausea, and malaise) were collected. The association between lifestyle habits, health factors, athletic activity conditions (explanatory variables), and EHE-related symptoms (objective variables) was analyzed using the partial-proportional odds model. \"Perceived dehydration\" (odds ratios [ORs] 1.70-2.31, p < 0.002),\" \"sickness\" (ORs 1.35-1.76), p < 0.001), \"perceived accumulated fatigue\" (ORs 1.13-1.31, p ≤ 0.001), \"perceived mental stress\" (ORs 1.17-1.31, p < 0.019), \"lack of ambient wind\" (ORs 1.12-1.19, p < 0.022), \"loss of appetite\" (ORs 1.16-1.23, p < 0.037), and \"sleep deprivation\" (ORs 1.15-1.17, p < 0.025) were positively associated with EHE-related symptoms, whereas \"using an air conditioner during sleeping\" (ORs 0.91, p = 0.047) during summer seasons was negatively associated. These findings suggest that athletes should be allowed to postpone or downregulate exercise intensity and/or volume based on their perceptions of dehydration, sickness, accumulated fatigue, mental stress, loss of appetite, and/or sleep deprivation in the summer to prevent heat illness.\n",

      "ATP and NAD\n",
      "The goal of this study is to identify a signature of bioenergetic and functional markers in the muscles of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Quantitative physiological properties of in vivo hand muscle (FDI, first dorsal interosseus) and leg muscle (TA, Tibialis Anterior) of older individuals with PD were compared to historical age/gender-matched controls (N = 30). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging (MRS) were used to assess in vivo mitochondrial and cell energetic dysfunction, including maximum mitochondrial ATP production (ATPmax), NAD concentrations linked to energy/stress pathways, and muscle size. Muscle function was measured via a single muscle fatigue test. TA ATPmax and NAD levels were significantly lower in the PD cohort compared to controls (ATPmax: 0.66 mM/s ± 0.03 vs. 0.76 ± 0.02; NAD: 0.75 mM ± 0.05 vs. 0.91 ± 0.04). Muscle endurance and specific force were also lower in both hand and leg muscles in the PD subjects. Exploratory analyses of mitochondrial markers and individual symptoms suggested that higher ATPmax was associated with a greater sense of motivation and engagement and less REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). ATPmax was not associated with clinical severity or individual symptom(s), years since diagnosis, or quality of life. Results from this pilot study contribute to a growing body of evidence that PD is not a brain disease, but a systemic metabolic syndrome with disrupted cellular energetics and function in peripheral tissues. The significant impairment of both mitochondrial ATP production and resting metabolite levels in the TA muscles of the PD patients suggests that skeletal muscle mitochondrial function may be an important tool for mechanistic understanding and clinical application in PD patients. This study looked at individuals with mid-stage PD; future research should evaluate whether the observed metabolic perturbations in muscle dysfunction occur in the early stages of the disease and whether they have value as theragnostic biomarkers.\n",

CKD poses a particularly heavy burden in low- and middle-income countries, which are least able to cope with its consequences. It has become one of the leading causes of death worldwide and is one of the few non-communicable diseases where the number of related deaths has increased over the last two decades. The high number of people affected, and the significant negative impact of CKD should be a reason to increase efforts to improve prevention and treatment. The interaction of lung and kidney leads to highly complex and difficult clinical scenarios. CKD significantly affects the physiology of the lung by altering fluid homeostasis, acid-base balance and vascular tone. In the lung, haemodynamic disturbances lead to the development of alterations in ventilatory control, pulmonary congestion, capillary stress failure and pulmonary vascular disease. In the kidney, haemodynamic disturbances lead to sodium and water retention and the deterioration of renal function. In this article, we would like to draw attention to the importance of harmonising the definitions of clinical events in pneumology and renal medicine. We would also like to highlight the need for pulmonary function tests in routine clinical practise for the management of patients with CKD, in order to find new concepts for pathophysiological based disease-specific management strategies.\n",

      "Molecular Mechanisms Responsible for Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Based Modulation of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.\n",
      "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells that reside in almost all postnatal tissues where, due to the potent regenerative, pro-angiogenic and immunomodulatory properties, regulate tissue homeostasis. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) induces oxidative stress, inflammation and ischemia which recruit MSCs from their niches in inflamed and injured tissues. Through the activity of MSC-sourced anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors, MSCs reduce hypoxia, suppress inflammation, prevent fibrosis and enhance regeneration of damaged cells in OSA-injured tissues. The results obtained in large number of animal studies demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in the attenuation of OSA-induced tissue injury and inflammation. Herewith, in this review article, we emphasized molecular mechanisms which are involved in MSC-based neo-vascularization and immunoregulation and we summarized current knowledge about MSC-dependent modulation of OSA-related pathologies.\n",

      "Vinyasa yoga practice improves body fitness and potentially positively affects practitioners' well-being and health. Due to the diverse intensity of practice and positions customized to the practitioner's needs, it can also support cancer patients. Undertaking physical activity that has a potentially positive effect on well-being and health was particularly important during the self-isolation that followed the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of three-month mild and moderate intensity vinyasa yoga practice on breast-cancer patients' stress perception, self-confidence, and sleep quality during COVID-19 induced self-isolation.\n",
      "Female breast-cancer patients participated in twelve-weeks of online vinyasa practice during the COVID-19 induced self-isolation period. Meetings were held once a week, where 60-min vinyasa yoga sequences were followed by 15 min of relaxation. Patients completed pre- and post-intervention surveys to evaluate changes in the following outcomes: stress perception, self-confidence, and sleep quality. Forty-one female patients enrolled in the Vinyasa course completed the pre-intervention survey, while 13 attended all the meetings and completed the post-intervention survey.\n",
      "The effect of the twelve-week yoga and relaxation practice significantly reduced sleep problems and stress of oncological patients. The participants also declared an improvement in their general well-being and self-acceptance.\n",
      "Dynamic forms of yoga combined with mindfulness techniques can be applied to patients treated for oncological diseases. It contributes to improving their well-being. However, in-depth studies are needed to analyze the complexity of this effect.\n",

      "Insomnia is the perception of inadequate, insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Of all sleep-related disorders, insomnia is the most common. It is important to remember that the sleep-wake cycle also plays a central role in the genesis of anxiety and depression. The aim of our study is to evaluate the association between sleep disturbances and anxiety and depression in a group of workers of both sexes who perform night shift work.\n",
      "Information on sleep disorders was collected by administering the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaire. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Chi-square test to assess whether there were any differences between sex for those who were healthy or who were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders.\n",
      "The results showed that there was a good percentage of subjects with insomnia problems, impairing normal daily activities and promoting the onset of fatigue, daytime sleepiness, cognitive performance deficits and mood disorders.\n",

Moreover, we explored whether the chronotype can moderate the potential associations between lifetime post-traumatic stress spectrum symptoms and rest-activity circadian and sleep-related parameters. A total of 74 BD patients were administered the Trauma and Loss Spectrum Self-Report (TALS-SR) lifetime version for lifetime post-traumatic stress spectrum symptoms, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for self-reported sleep quality, and the Reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ) to discriminate evening chronotypes (ETs), neither chronotype (NT), and morning chronotype (MT). Actigraphic monitoring was used to objectively evaluate sleep and circadian parameters. Patients classified as ET reported significantly higher scores in the re-experiencing domain, as well as poorer sleep quality, lower sleep efficiency, increased wake after sleep onset, and delayed mid-sleep point compared with both NT and MT (\n",

      "Effects of Live Music on the Perception of Noise in the SICU/PICU: A Patient, Caregiver, and Medical Staff Environmental Study.\n",
      "Intensive Care Units (ICUs) require a multidisciplinary team that consists of, but is not limited to, intensivists (clinicians who specialize in critical illness care), pharmacists and nurses, respiratory care therapists, and other medical consultants from a broad range of specialties. The complex and demanding critical care environment provides few opportunities for patients and personal and professional caregivers to evaluate how sound effects them. A growing body of literature attests to noise's adverse influence on patients' sleep, and high sound levels are a source of staff stress, as noise is an ubiquitous and noxious stimuli. Vulnerable patients have a low threshold tolerance to audio-induced stress. Despite these indications, peak sound levels often register as high, as can ventilators, and the documented noise levels in hospitals continue to rise. This baseline study, carried out in two hospitals' Surgical and Pediatric Intensive Care Units, measured the effects of live music on the perception of noise through surveying patients, personal caregivers and staff in randomized conditions of no music, and music as provided by music therapists through our hospital system's environmental music therapy program.\n",

      "Ergonomics of E-Learning Workstations and the Prevalence of Musculoskeletal Disorders-Study among University Students.\n",
      "The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) has increased significantly in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a fundamental change in the lifestyles, ways of learning and working patterns of the general population, which in turn, might lead to health consequences. The aim of this study was to evaluate the conditions of e-learning and the impact of the learning modality on the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms among university students in Poland. This cross-sectional study included 914 students who completed an anonymous questionnaire. The questions covered two time periods (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic) and were aimed at obtaining information about lifestyle (including physical activity using the modified International Physical Activity Questionnaire, 2007 (IPAQ), perceived stress and sleep patterns), the ergonomics of computer workstations (by Rapid Office Strain Assessment, 2012 (ROSA) method), the incidence and severity of musculoskeletal symptoms (by the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire, 2018 (NMQ)) and headaches. The main differences between the two periods were statistically significant according to the Wilcoxon test in terms of physical activity, computer use time, and severity of headaches. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in MSD (68.2% vs. 74.6%) and their intensity (2.83 ± 2.36 vs. 3.50 ± 2.79 points) among the student population (\n",

The secondary objective was to assess the frequency and type of GI and feeding disorders in a sample of children with ASD through a multidisciplinary assessment and, finally, to investigate families' perceptions and satisfaction with the proposed multidisciplinary approach. All children underwent a comprehensive gastroenterological and neuropsychiatric evaluation supported by standardized questionnaires. Pediatric gastroenterologists, specifically trained in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), provided advice for parent-delivered behavioral intervention for food selectivity. Thirty-six children with an autism diagnosis (29 males, age 4.5 +/-2.2 years, mean +/- SD) were enrolled. A positive correlation between sleep problems and aggressive behavior was found, and this association was stronger in children experiencing more problematic mealtime behaviors (b = 0.788, \n",

      "Habitual Videogame Playing Does Not Compromise Subjective Sleep Quality and Is Associated with Improved Daytime Functioning.\n",
      "Research on the effects of videogames (VGs) on health has produced mixed results. Here, we assess the relationships of VG playing with sleep; chronotype; sleepiness; and levels of depression, anxiety, and stress; and how they are modulated by the level of exposure to VGs. Four hundred-and two adult participants (age = 26.2 ± 7.84; 227 F) completed an online survey including questions on VG use and a set of standardized questionnaires. The sample was divided into three groups: habitual gamers (HGs, 42.2%), nonhabitual gamers (NHGs, 36.5%), and non-gamers (NGs, 21.3%). No between-group differences emerged in sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) or Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index measures except the sleep disturbances subscore, which was higher in NHGs. HGs showed delayed bed- and risetimes and higher eveningness (reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire). HGs and NHGs showed higher depression subscores (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale) but remained in the subclinical range. Moreover, hours/week of VG playing predicted delayed sleep timing, lower daytime dysfunction, and lower sleepiness. Our data suggest that VG playing does not necessarily compromise sleep quality and may even benefit daytime functioning, underlining the need to reconsider the relationships between VG use and health by taking into account possible modulating factors such as habitual VG exposure.\n",

      "Evidence for Choosing Qigong as an Integrated Intervention in Cancer Care: An Umbrella Review.\n",
      "Cancer is the second leading cause of noncommunicable disease death, with an increasing incidence. Qigong practice can moderate non-intrinsic, modifiable risk factors that act on the stress response using physical movements, breathing, and focused attention. The purpose of this umbrella review is to provide a concise summary to facilitate an evidence-based decision to integrate Qigong into cancer patients' care. Relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identified and retrieved from the JBI database, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. Of all of the studies assessed, none found evidence of a risk to cancer patients, indicating that Qigong is a safe practice that can be used even by frail patients. The overall quality of life, cancer-related fatigue, and cognitive impairment were improved by Qigong. Different Qigong programs have different impacts on sleep quality and gastrointestinal problems, suggesting that longer practice sessions are required to achieve improvements. To maintain Qigong's effectiveness, an ordinary practice is essential, or such effectiveness will wear off. The use of biological markers in efficacy assessments needs to be more systematically studied. However, positive WBC, RBC, and CRP trends in Qigong practitioners are evident. Higher-quality clinical studies are necessary to measure variables more closely related to Qigong functioning and consider cancer's multifactorial nature.\n",

      "CaMKII-Dependent Contractile Dysfunction and Pro-Arrhythmic Activity in a Mouse Model of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.\n",
      "Left ventricular contractile dysfunction and arrhythmias frequently occur in patients with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The CaMKII-dependent dysregulation of cellular Ca homeostasis has recently been described in SDB patients, but these studies only partly explain the mechanism and are limited by the patients' heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed contractile function and Ca homeostasis in a mouse model of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that is not limited by confounding comorbidities. OSA was induced by artificial tongue enlargement with polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) injection into the tongue of wildtype mice and mice with a genetic ablation of the oxidative activation sites of CaMKII (MMVV knock-in). After eight weeks, cardiac function was assessed with echocardiography. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca transients were measured using confocal and epifluorescence microscopy, respectively. Wildtype PTFE mice exhibited an impaired ejection fraction, while MMVV PTFE mice were fully protected. As expected, isolated cardiomyocytes from PTFE mice showed increased ROS production. We further observed decreased levels of steady-state Ca transients, decreased levels of caffeine-induced Ca transients, and increased pro-arrhythmic activity (defined as deviations from the diastolic Ca baseline) only in wildtype but not in MMVV PTFE mice. In summary, in the absence of any comorbidities, OSA was associated with contractile dysfunction and pro-arrhythmic activity and the inhibition of the oxidative activation of CaMKII conveyed cardioprotection, which may have therapeutic implications.\n",

      "Polyphenol-Rich Beverages and Mental Health Outcomes.\n",
      "Emerging evidence suggests that diets rich in plant-based foods and beverages may exert plausible effects on human health tackling the risk of chronic diseases. Although the data are promising for numerous outcomes, including cardiovascular diseases, the data on mental health are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between individual polyphenol-rich beverages intake and mental health outcomes, such as perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality, among adult individuals living in the Mediterranean area. The demographic and dietary characteristics of a sample of 1572 adults living in southern Italy were analysed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses, controlling for confounding factors, were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the association between individual polyphenol-rich and alcoholic beverages containing polyphenols and mental health outcomes. The multivariate model adjusted for background covariates and the Mediterranean diet showed that individuals with a moderate intake (up to 1 cup/glass per day) of coffee and tea were less likely to have high perceived stress (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.45-0.84) and depressive symptoms (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.39-0.80), respectively. Furthermore, regular coffee and moderate/regular red wine drinkers were less likely to have depressive symptoms (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.95 and OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.54-0.99, respectively). No significant associations were retrieved for the intake of polyphenol-rich and alcoholic beverages and sleep quality. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that polyphenol-rich beverages may be associated with mental health, in terms of depressive symptoms and perceived stress. Nonetheless, further research exploring how the polyphenol-rich beverages impact brain health and what the optimal patterns of consumption are for different populations are warranted.\n",

      "The Impact of Clinical Pilates Exercises on Tension-Type Headaches: A Case Series.\n",
      "Tension-type-headaches appear as the third most common disease in the general population and have a big impact on quality of life. The aim is to verify the impact of clinical Pilates exercises on pain intensity, impact headaches, neck disability, state of anxiety, depression, stress and quality of sleep in higher-education students. After a sample selection questionnaire was completed, a series of cases was carried out with 9 undergraduate students with tension-type headaches. Five instruments were applied before and after an intervention program: (i) Numerical Rating Scale-NRS, (ii) Headache Impact Test-HIT-6™, (iii) Neck Disability Index, (iv) Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales and (v) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Four sessions of 30 min classes of Pilates exercises were held for 2 weeks. The pain intensity decreased in only 2 participants. The impact of tension-type headaches on normal daily life and ability to function was improved in all patients, and only one patient's functional disability caused by pain in the cervical region did not improve. In regard to negative emotional states, 6 individuals reported improvements, and only one individual reported a lower quality of sleep after the program. The exercise program can induce positive effects on disorders associated with tension-type-headaches.\n",

      "Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease, with most cases experiencing skin barrier dysfunction and enhanced allergen entry, accompanied by cytokine production which evokes predominantly type-2-skewed immune responses, itch, and scratching behavior. Although intense itch and excessive scratching behavior affect progression of skin lesions, it is unclear what causes them. Data suggest that scratching behavior stimulates brain dopaminergic reward and habit learning systems, strengthening habitual scratching behavior, while nocturnal scratching behavior presumably increases locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system activity, prompting sleep disturbances. At the early stage of atopic dermatitis, increased cortisol levels, due to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis overactivation caused by such system stimulation, can induce dorsolateral prefrontal cortex disturbance with reinforcement of habitual scratching behavior and may aggravate type-2-skewed immune responses in the skin. During the later phases, whereas blunted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and the shift of type-2-dominated to type-1-co-dominated inflammation are induced, noradrenergic system overactivation-associated dorsolateral prefrontal cortex disruption is ongoing and responsible for itch cognitive distortion to catastrophize about itch, which leads to a vicious spiral along with habitual scratching behavior and skin lesions. Data are presented in this review indicating that while skin immune system dysfunction initiates pathological changes in atopic dermatitis, brain neural network and stress system alterations can promote the progression of this condition. It is also suggested that cognitive distortion contributes to pathology in atopic dermatitis as with some psychiatric disorders and chronic pain. The proposed mechanistic model could lead to development of novel medications for slowing or terminating the relentless progression of this disorder. \n",

      "Role for μ-opioid receptor in antidepressant effects of δ-opioid receptor agonist KNT-127.\n",
      "Previous pharmacological data have shown the possible existence of functional interactions between μ- (MOP), κ- (KOP), and δ-opioid receptors (DOP) in pain and mood disorders. We previously reported that MOP knockout (KO) mice exhibit a lower stress response compared with wildtype (WT) mice. Moreover, DOP agonists have been shown to exert antidepressant-like effects in numerous animal models. In the present study, the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST) were used to examine the roles of MOP and DOP in behavioral despair. MOP-KO mice and WT mice were treated with KNT-127 (10 mg/kg), a selective DOP agonist. The results indicated a significant decrease in immobility time in the KNT-127 group compared with the saline group in all genotypes in both tests. In the saline groups, immobility time significantly decreased in MOP-KO mice compared with WT mice in both tests. In female MOP-KO mice, KNT-127 significantly decreased immobility time in the TST compared with WT mice. In male MOP-KO mice, however, no genotypic differences were found in the TST after either KNT-127 or saline treatment. Thus, at least in the FST and TST, the activation of DOP and absence of MOP had additive effects in reducing measures of behavioral despair, suggesting that effects on this behavior by DOP activation occur independently of MOP.\n",

      "The Role of Emotion Dysregulation in the Relationship Between Sleep Disturbances and PTSD Symptom Severity.\n",
      "Emotion dysregulation is implicated in the development, maintenance, and treatment of sleep disturbances and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) separately. However, few studies have assessed interactions among these variables. To address this gap, this study examined whether the associations of sleep quality and sleep quantity with PTSD severity were stronger at higher levels of negative and positive emotion dysregulation in a community sample of 199 trauma-exposed individuals. This study found that both poorer sleep quality and lower sleep quantity were associated with greater PTSD severity at low to average (but not high) levels of negative emotion dysregulation. Positive emotion dysregulation did not moderate the relationships between sleep quality or quantity and PTSD severity. Exploratory additive multiple moderation analyses showed significant associations between poorer sleep quality and lower sleep quantity with greater PTSD severity at low to average levels of negative emotion dysregulation, coupled with any level of positive emotion dysregulation. Findings inform theoretical perspectives on the sleep-PTSD relationship and clinical applications of targeting emotion dysregulation in the treatment of sleep disturbances and PTSD symptoms for trauma-exposed individuals.\n",

A subset provided blood samples (n2019=1957) for detection of nine biomarkers and was surveyed in three successive years (social jetlag calculated for n2018/19/20=3930/1601/1237). Data were analyzed by nonparametric univariate tests and mixed-effects multivariate regression with social jetlag, chronotype, sex, age, BMI and reported diseases as predictors and biomarker levels as outcomes.\n",

Extreme chronotypes were associated with cardiovascular disease risk markers regardless of social jetlag (Kruskal-Wallis, p<0.0001). Commuting to work and time stress were identified as important contributors to social jetlag.

Differences between groups were calculated using Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc Mann-Whitney tests.\n",
      "Out of 914 patients, 231 (25%) had no trauma, 210 (23%) accidental traumas, 283 (31%) interpersonal traumas, 99 (11%) PTSD, and 91 (10%) could not be classified. We observed statistically significant differences between groups in pain area and widespreadness, as well as maximal pain, sleep impairment, disability, stress, anxiety, depression, and somatization.

      "Stress has a huge negative impact on sleep routines and the quality of life of individuals. Sleep is considered an important modulator of the immune response. Thus, a lack of sleep can weaken immunity, increasing organism susceptibility to infection. For instance, shorter sleep durations are associated with a rise in suffering from the common cold. The administration of melatonin protects against viral and other pathogens and speeds clinical recovery.\n",
      "In patients admitted to intensive care units, melatonin decreases the risks of severe complications, such as thrombosis and sepsis, and mortality rates. In addition, it is efficacious in lowering vessel permeability, depression, and sedation, and improving the quality of sleep, which could also help COVID-19 patients achieve better clinical outcomes.\n",

      "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a sleep-disordered breathing characterized by nocturnal collapses of the upper airway resulting in cycles of blood oxygen partial pressure oscillations, which lead to tissue and cell damage due to intermittent hypoxia (IH) episodes. Since OSAS-derived IH may lead to cognitive impairment through not fully cleared mechanisms, herein we developed a new in vitro model mimicking IH conditions to shed light on its molecular effects on microglial cells, with particular attention to the inflammatory response. The in vitro model was set-up and validated by measuring the hypoxic state, HIF-1α levels, oxidative stress by ROS production and mitochondrial activity by MTS assay. Then, the mRNA and protein levels of certain inflammatory markers (NF-κB and interleukin 6 (IL-6)) after different IH treatment protocols were investigated. The IH treatments followed by a normoxic period were not able to produce a high inflammatory state in human microglial cells. Nevertheless, microglia appeared to be in a state characterized by increased expression of NF-κB and markers related to a primed phenotype. The microglia exposed to IH cycles and stimulated with exogenous IL-1β resulted in an exaggerated inflammatory response with increased NF-κB and IL-6 expression, suggesting a role for primed microglia in OSAS-driven neuroinflammation.\n",

      "Moral injury and distress (MID), which occurs when individuals have significant dissonance with their belief system and overwhelming feelings of being powerless to do what is believed to be right, has not been explored in the unique population of military surgeons deployed far forward in active combat settings. Deployed military surgeons provide care to both injured soldiers and civilians under command-driven medical rules of engagement (MROE) in variably resourced settings. This practice setting has no civilian corollary for comparison or current specific tool for measurement.\n",
      "To characterize MID among military surgeons deployed during periods of high casualty volumes through a mixed-methods approach.\n",
      "This qualitative study using convergent mixed methods was performed from May 2020 to October 2020. Participants included US military surgeons who had combat deployments to a far-forward role 2 treatment facility during predefined peak casualty periods in Iraq (2003-2008) and Afghanistan (2009-2012), as identified by purposeful snowball sampling. Data analysis was performed from October 2020 to May 2021.\n",
      "Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) survey and individual, semistructured interviews were conducted to thematic saturation.\n",
      "The total cohort included 20 surgeons (mean [SD] age, 38.1 [5.2] years); 16 (80%) were male, and 16 (80%) had 0 or 1 prior deployment. Deployment locations were Afghanistan (11 surgeons [55%]), Iraq (9 surgeons [45%]), or both locations (3 surgeons [15%]). The mean (SD) MMD-HP score for the surgeons was 104.1 (39.3). The primary thematic domains for MID were distressing outcomes (DO) and MROE. The major subdomains of DO were guilt related to witnessing horrific injuries; treating pregnant women, children, and US soldiers; and second-guessing decisions. The major subdomains for MROE were forced transfer of civilian patients, limited capabilities and resources, inexperience in specialty surgical procedures, and communication with command. Postdeployment manifestations of MID were common and affected sleep, medical practice, and interpersonal relationships.\n",
      "In this qualitative study, MID was ubiquitous in deployed military surgeons. Thematic observations about MID, specifically concerning the domains of DO and MROE, may represent targets for further study to develop an evaluation tool of MID in this population and inform possible programs for identification and mitigation of MID.\n",

      "This study sought to explore the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on spatial memory deficits caused by surgery.\n",
      "Hepatic apex resection was performed under propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to EA treatment or EA + mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (mdivi-1) treatment once a day for three consecutive days after surgery. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate the spatial memory of the rats after surgery. Tissue from the hippocampus of each rat was frozen and used for transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to identify potential targets for EA treatment. Western blotting was used to confirm the protein expression levels. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were detected using commercial kits. The rat mitochondria were then isolated, and the activity of mitochondrial complex V was assessed.\n",
      "EA attenuated surgery-induced spatial memory deficits on postoperative day 3, while these effects were reversed by treatment with the mdivi-1 (P<0.05). Ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing revealed that EA upregulated multiple metabolic pathways and the phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinas/protein kinase B signaling pathway. The proteomic and western blotting results suggested that the EA treatment substantially downregulated coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 3 (ChChd3) expression in the hippocampus. The EA treatment significantly increased the autophagy-related protein levels, including phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced kinase 1, Parkin, MAP1LC3 (LC3), and Beclin1, and inhibited the production of ROS and inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β in the hippocampus (P<0.05).\n",
      "These results suggest that EA ameliorates postoperative spatial memory deficits and protects hippocampus from oxidative stress and inflammation through enhanced autophagy in an animal model of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs).\n",

      "Physiological Role of Orexin/Hypocretin in the Human Body in Motivated Behavior: A Comprehensive Review.\n",
      "Neurohormones are neurosecretory materials released by neurosecretory cells that serve both as neuromodulators in the brain and spinal cord and as circulating regulatory hormones. They serve a wide range of functions, including homeostasis, development, and modulation of neuronal and muscle activity. In the hypothalamus, neurohormones called hypocretins are created that were discovered in the late nineties. Orexin receptors (OXRs) have been shown to enhance synaptic signaling in the central nervous system at the cellular level. The orexins improve stimulated neural activity in the hippocampus, which, in turn, aids with spatial memory, learning, and mood. They present themselves as mediators for the hypothalamic functions. They have been shown to regulate sleep-wake cycles, arousal mechanisms, addiction, sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), blood pressure, and thermogenesis. Its role in storing brown adipose tissue has implications for thermal homeostasis. The significant role of orexins is seen in tumorigenesis when orexin A (OrxA) and orexin B (OrxB) induce apoptosis in fast-growing tumor cells. Orexin-null subjects show clinical narcolepsy, indicating that orexins were responsible for keeping them awake. Orexin microinjections in mice brains stimulated increased physical activity, thus possibly countering diet-induced obesity. Physical activity significantly increased plasma orexin-A levels, which facilitated the process of energy homeostasis. The amount of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) increases in stress conditions, which further facilitates the release of the stress hormone cortisol. No increase in the ACTH hormone is seen in stressed mice administered with orexin receptor 2 (OX2R) antagonists thus showing orexin's role in stress reaction. As a result of linking hypocretin/orexin to various physiological procedures, increased research into the medicinal potential of drugs targeting these receptors is emerging. We summed up in this review the recent advances in our understanding of how orexin and its receptor system play an essential role in clinical and pathological functions. This research summarizes a new area for research in human medicine, providing the possibility of controlling a vast array of physiological functions through intra-cerebroventricular injections of a single neuropeptide.\n",

      "Based on the theoretical model for the \"stress-sleep\" relationship, this study investigated the impact of parental phubbing on adolescent sleep quality problems and a moderated mediation mechanism.\n",
      "A total of 781 adolescents was surveyed using the Chinese version of Parental Phubbing Scale, the Ultra-brief Screening Scale for Depression and Anxiety Scale, the Self-Control Questionnaire for Chinese children, and the Chinese version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Scale.\n",
      "Parental phubbing and negative emotions were significantly and positively correlated to sleep quality problems, but self-control was not correlated to sleep quality problems. Parental phubbing directly influenced sleep quality problems and also indirectly influenced sleep quality problems through the mediating effect of negative emotions. Moreover, self-control played a moderating role in the path of parental phubbing affecting negative emotions. That is, the effect was more significant for adolescents low in self-control relative to those high in self-control.\n",

      "Evolutionary theories suggest that dreams function as a world simulator of events that maximizes our ability to surmount social and threat-related challenges critical to survivorship and reproduction. Here, in contrast to the incorporation continuity hypothesis, we test the (1) social bias hypothesis, which states that dreams will overrepresent positive social interactions relative to waking life, (2) the mutually exclusive threat bias hypothesis, the idea that dream content will be negative relative to waking life, (3) the strengthening hypothesis, which states that dreams will rehearse more positive interactions with individuals the self is familiar with relative to waking life, and (4) the compensation hypothesis, which states that social contents in dreams increases during periods of social seclusion.

      "Cognitive function in soccer athletes determined by sleep disruption and self-reported health, yet not by decision-reinvestment.\n",
      "Sleep disruption (SD) increases sympathetic activity and cortisol secretion, and delays cognitive functions such as reaction-time (RT). Sympathetic activity of disturbed sleepers, is similar to those of so-called decision-reinvesters. Decision-reinvestment refers to traits in individuals with greater tendency to ruminate and reinvest in their decisions, with significant decrease in both motor-control and cognitive performance. Decision-making quality is a crucial attribute to athletic performance which relies on RT. Consequently, SD affects pitch-performance negatively, particularly in decision-reinvesters. This observational pilot-study examined the relationship between SD and cognitive function, perceived health, as well as reinvestment strategies. The hypothesis was that athletes with lower SD perceive their health better, report lower stress levels, perform better in cognitive tasks, and show lower tendency for decision-reinvestment.\n",
      "Twenty-one football player recorded their sleep with fit-trackers for 7 nights. Participants self-reported their mental and physical health, decision-reinvestment strategy, sleep behaviour, and perceived stress levels. Athletes then performed a set of cognitive tests to examine memory function (Backwards Corsi), selective attention (STROOP), and cognitive flexibility (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST). Normality was tested with a Shapiro-Wilk test, and analysed with a Pearson's or Spearman's correlation test.\n",
      "Significant correlation appeared between extended sleep-interruptions and Backwards Corsi RT, r = 0.66, \n",
      "Wellbeing relies on total sleep-time. Athletes with extended sleep-interruptions are slower in recalling memory, and those with greater reported pain have lower memory scores. Participants who rate physical health greater, have more error-rates in the WCST; indicating that cognitive flexibility is enhanced in individuals with inferior perceived health. However, individuals with lower physical health scores also have greater tendency to ruminate and reinvest in decisions, suggesting interrelation between reinvestment and physical health.\n",

      "Many risk factors impact the health of hospital night workers, which can lead to physical and mental health disorders. During the recent period, night hospital workers have been particularly stressed. This study therefore aims to: (i) To document the prevalence of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and symptoms suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder in night shift workers (NSHW) working in Parisian public hospitals after France's first COVID-19 wave ended; (ii) To estimate the effect of negative representations and perceptions of night shift work on these mental health outcomes.\n",
      "An observational cross-sectional online survey of NSHW (June to September 2020) in 39 public hospitals in Paris, France. Standard scales were used to measure mental health outcomes. Weighted multinomial logistic regression models supported the identification of predictors of depression (score > 10 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS, for depression), anxiety (score > 10 on the HADS for anxiety), severe insomnia (score > 21 on the Insomnia Severity Index, ISI) and symptoms suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder (score > 36 on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, IES-R).\n",
      "The weighted prevalence rates [95% confidence interval] of depression, anxiety, severe insomnia, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder were, respectively, 18.9% [16.5-21.2], 7.6% [6.0-9.1], 8.6% [6.9-10.2] and 11.7% [9.7-13.6]. After multiple adjustment, organizational changes in NSHW professional lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic (such as moving to another hospital department and modified schedules) and NSHW-perceived negative representations of night work were significantly associated with all studied mental health outcomes.\n",
      "Our findings confirm the importance of monitoring mental health and sleep quality among NSHW in Parisian public hospitals, even more during health crises. Multilevel interventions aiming at reducing negative representations and improving work organization are urgently needed to improve overall health of this frontline healthcare providers group.\n",

Current cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) for these disorders do not address sleep, while good sleep is essential for regulating emotions and learning new cognitions and behaviours: the core fundaments of CBT. This transdiagnostic randomized control trial (RCT) evaluates whether guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) (1) improves sleep, (2) affects the progression of emotional distress and (3) enhances the effectiveness of regular treatment of people with clinically relevant symptoms of emotional disorders across all mental health care (MHC) echelons.\n",
      "We aim for 576 completers with clinically relevant symptoms of insomnia as well as at least one of the dimensions of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), panic disorder (PD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD). Participants are either pre-clinical, unattended, or referred to general- or specialized MHC. Using covariate-adaptive randomization, participants will be assigned to a 5 to 8-week iCBT-I (i-Sleep) or a control condition (sleep diary only) and assessed at baseline, and after two and eight months. The primary outcome is insomnia severity. Secondary outcomes address sleep, severity of mental health symptoms, daytime functioning, mental health protective lifestyles, well-being, and process evaluation measures.

      "Although both nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep loss and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep loss exacerbate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, they exert different effects. Microglial activation can be beneficial or detrimental to AD patients under different conditions. However, few studies have investigated which sleep stage is the main regulator of microglial activation or the downstream effects of this activation. We aimed to explore the roles of different sleep phases in microglial activation and to investigate the possible effect of microglial activation on AD pathology. In this study, thirty-six 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice were equally divided into 3 groups: the stress control (SC), total sleep deprivation (TSD), and REM deprivation (RD) groups. All mice underwent a 48-hour intervention before their spatial memory was assessed using a Morris water maze (MWM). Then, microglial morphology, activation- and synapse-related protein expression, and inflammatory cytokine and amyloid β (Aβ) levels in hippocampal tissues were measured. We found that the RD and TSD groups exhibited worse spatial memory in the MWM tests. In addition, the RD and TSD groups showed greater microglial activation, higher inflammatory cytokine levels, lower synapse-related protein expression and more severe Aβ accumulation than the SC group, but there were no significant differences between the RD and TSD groups. This study demonstrates that disturbance of REM sleep may activate microglia in APP/PS1 mice. These activated microglia may promote neuroinflammation and engulf synapses but show a weakened ability to clear plaques.\n",

PTSS were measured every 3 months from April 2020 using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Patients also completed questionnaires on their quality of life, cognitive complaints, insomnia, and COVID-19 lockdown experience.\n",
      "Longitudinal analyses involved 386 patients with at least one PTSS assessment after baseline (median age, 63 years; 76% female). Among them, 21.5% had moderate/severe PTSS during the first lockdown. The rate of patients reporting PTSS decreased at lockdown release (13.6%), increased again at second lockdown (23.2%), and slightly declined from the second release period (22.7%) to the third lockdown (17.5%). Patients were grouped into 3 trajectories of evolution. Most patients had stable low symptoms throughout the period, 6% had high baseline symptoms slowly decreasing over time, and 17.6% had moderate symptoms worsening during the second lockdown. Female sex, feeling socially isolated, worrying about COVID-19 infection, and using psychotropic drugs were associated with PTSS.

      "Separating the influences of means and daily variations of sleep on the stress-induced salivary cortisol response.\n",
      "Previous research regarding the effects of sleep quality and quantity on the acute stress response has yielded inconsistent findings. This may be attributed to various factors, including composite sleep components (i.e., means and daily variations) and mixed cortisol stress response (i.e., reactivity and recovery). Thus, this study aimed to separate the effects of means and daily variations of sleep on the reactivity and recovery of cortisol responses to psychological challenges.\n",
      "In study 1, we recruited 41 healthy participants (24 women; age range, 18-23 years), monitored their sleep during seven consecutive days via wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries, and adopted the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) paradigm to induce acute stress. Study 2 consisted of a validation experiment using the ScanSTRESS paradigm, which included 77 additional healthy individuals (35 women; age range, 18-26 years). Similarly to the TSST, the ScanSTRESS induces acute stress using uncontrollability and social evaluation. In both studies, saliva samples from the participants were collected before, during, and after the acute stress task.\n",
      "Using residual dynamic structural equation modeling, both study 1 and study 2 demonstrated that higher means of objective sleep efficiency, and longer means of objective sleep duration were related to greater cortisol recovery. In addition, fewer daily variations in objective sleep duration were associated with greater cortisol recovery. However, there was no correlation between sleep variables and cortisol reactivity, except for the daily variations in objective sleep duration in study 2. No correlation was observed between subjective sleep and cortisol response to stress.\n",
      "The present study separated two features of multi-day sleep patterns and two components of cortisol stress response, providing a more comprehensive picture of the effect of sleep on the stress-induced salivary cortisol response, and contributing to the future development of targeted interventions for stress-related disorders.\n",

      "Effectiveness of tailored digital health interventions for mental health at the workplace: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials.\n",
      "Mental health problems in the workplace are common and have a considerable impact on employee wellbeing and productivity. Mental ill-health costs employers between £33 billion and £42 billion a year. According to a 2020 HSE report, roughly 2,440 per 100,000 workers in the UK were affected by work-related stress, depression, or anxiety, resulting in an estimated 17.9 million working days lost. We performed a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effect of tailored digital health interventions provided in the workplace aiming to improve mental health, presenteeism and absenteeism of employees. We searched several databases for RCTs published from 2000 onwards. Data were extracted into a standardised data extraction form. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Due to the heterogeneity of outcome measures, narrative synthesis was used to summarise the findings. Seven RCTs (eight publications) were included that evaluated tailored digital interventions versus waiting list control or usual care to improve physical and mental health outcomes and work productivity. The results are promising to the advantage of tailored digital interventions regarding presenteeism, sleep, stress levels, and physical symptoms related to somatisation; but less for addressing depression, anxiety, and absenteeism. Even though tailored digital interventions did not reduce anxiety and depression in the general working population, they significantly reduced depression and anxiety in employees with higher levels of psychological distress. Tailored digital interventions seem more effective in employees with higher levels of distress, presenteeism or absenteeism than in the general working population. There was high heterogeneity in outcome measures, especially for work productivity; this should be a focus of attention in future studies.\n",

      "The Generation Gap Revisited: Generational Differences in Mental Health, Maladaptive Coping Behaviors, and Pandemic-Related Concerns During the Initial COVID-19 Pandemic.\n",
      "The purpose of this study was to assess differences in mental health symptoms, pandemic-related concerns, and maladaptive coping behaviors among adults in the United States across generations during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic. A social media campaign was used to recruit 2696 U.S. individuals to participate in an online survey in April 2020, assessing various validated psychosocial factors, including major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), perceived stress, loneliness, quality of life, and fatigue, along with pandemic-specific concerns and changes in alcohol use and substance use. Participants were grouped based on generation status (Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X, and Baby Boomer) and statistical comparisons were conducted based on demographics, psychosocial factors, pandemic-related concerns, and substance use. During the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic, the younger cohorts (Gen Z and Millennials) rated significantly worse on mental health indices, including major depression, GAD, perceived stress, loneliness, quality of life, and fatigue. Further, the participants in the Gen Z and Millennial generational groups exhibited greater increase in maladaptive coping with substance use, specifically alcohol use and increased use of sleep aids. Our results indicate that during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic, members of the Gen Z and Millennial generational cohorts were considered a psychologically vulnerable population due to their mental health and maladaptive coping behaviors. Improving access to mental health resources during early stages of a pandemic is an emerging public health concern.\n",

      "Modified prolonged exposure therapy as Early Intervention after Rape (The EIR-study): study protocol for a multicenter randomized add-on superiority trial.\n",
      "Sexual assault and rape are the traumatic life events with the highest probability for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can have devastating consequences for those afflicted by the condition. Studies indicate that modified prolonged exposure (mPE) therapy may be effective in preventing the development of PTSD in recently traumatized individuals, and especially for people who have experienced sexual assault. If a brief, manualized early intervention can prevent or reduce post-traumatic symptoms in women who have recently experienced rape, healthcare services targeted for these populations (i.e., sexual assault centers, SACs) should consider implementing such interventions as part of routine care.\n",
      "This is a multicenter randomized controlled add-on superiority trial that enrolls patients attending sexual assault centers within 72 h after rape or attempted rape. The objective is to assess whether mPE shortly after rape can prevent the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Patients will be randomized to either mPE plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. The primary outcome is the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms 3 months after trauma. Secondary outcomes will be symptoms of depression, sleep difficulties, pelvic floor hyperactivity, and sexual dysfunction. The first 22 subjects will constitute an internal pilot trial to test acceptance of the intervention and feasibility of the assessment battery.\n",
      "This study will guide further research and clinical initiatives for implementing strategies for preventing post-traumatic stress symptoms after rape and provide new knowledge about which women may benefit the most from such initiatives and for revising existing treatment guidelines within this area.\n",

      "Food insecurity and insomnia-related symptoms among adults from low- and middle-income countries.\n",
      "Little is known about the relationship between food insecurity and sleep problems in low- and middle-income countries, while the mediators of this association are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the association between food insecurity and insomnia-related symptoms in six low- and middle-income countries (i.e., China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa), and the potential mediators of this relationship. Cross-sectional, nationally representative data from the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (2007-2010) were analysed. Past 12-month food insecurity was assessed with two questions on the frequency of eating less, and on hunger owing to a lack of food. Insomnia-related symptoms referred to severe or extreme sleep problems in the past 30 days. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analysis were conducted. Data on 42,489 adults aged ≥18 years were analysed (mean [standard deviation] age 43.8 [14.4] years; 50.1% females). The prevalence of any food insecurity and insomnia-related symptoms was 11.9% and 4.4%, respectively. After adjustment, compared with no food insecurity, moderate (odds ratio = 1.53, 95% confidence interval = 1.11-2.10) and severe food insecurity (odds ratio = 2.35, 95% confidence interval = 1.56-3.55) were significantly associated with insomnia-related symptoms. Anxiety, perceived stress, and depression mediated 27.7%, 13.5%, and 12.5% of the relationship between any food insecurity and insomnia-related symptoms, respectively (total percentage = 43.3%). Food insecurity was positively associated with insomnia-related symptoms in adults from six low- and middle-income countries. Anxiety, perceived stress, and depression explained a substantial proportion of this relationship. Addressing food insecurity itself or the identified potential mediators among people with food insecurity may lead to a reduction in sleep problems among adults in low- and middle-income countries, pending confirmation with longitudinal studies.\n",

With a threshold of 5 to classify participants into good and poor sleep quality, with HADS/PSS-14 scores as independent variables (per standard deviation (SD) increment), respectively and binary Logistic regression model was constructed to explore the association between the three negative psychological aspects of depression, anxiety, and stress and sleep quality.\n",
      "The median PSQI score was 11.0 (mean ± SD: 11.8 ± 4.8). Among them, poor sleep quality (i.e., PSQI >5) was reported by 90.2% of participants. After adjusting for sociodemographic and disease-related information, HADS-depression was associated with a significant 49% (odds ratio (OR): 1.49; 95% CI 1.02-2.18) increase in the risk of poor sleep quality for each additional SD (2.4). Correspondingly, for each SD (7.1) increase in PSS-14, the risk of poor sleep quality was significantly increased by 95% (OR: 1.95; 95% CI 1.35-2.82).\n",

      "The present study aims to assess the influence of chronotype on lockdown-induced effects on sleep and psychological outcomes. A total of 1671 participants were recruited in France and filled out online questionnaires about their sleeping hours and sleep quality, their chronotype (morning, intermediate, evening type), and their depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms both retrospectively (before lockdown) and currently (during the lockdown). Statistical analyses estimated the chronotype effect on the impact of the lockdown on sleep and psychological outcomes. Results show that during the lockdown, sleep quality decreased, sleep duration increased, and sleep midpoint was delayed and, while fatigue perception decreased, anxiety and depression increased. The decrease in sleep quality varied according to the participants' chronotype. The evening type's sleep quality decreased the most. A similar chronotype effect was also observed on sleep duration and sleep midpoint. Evening-type participants also increased their depressive symptoms. These results suggest that evening-type individuals have lower resilience to lockdown effect on psychological status and sleep pattern.\n",

LC3B gene promoter regions were hypermethylated in OSA patients, particularly in those with excessive daytime sleepiness, while ATG5 gene promoter regions were hypermethylated in those with morning headache or memory impairment. LC3B protein expression of blood monocytes and DNA methylation levels of the LC3B gene promoter region were negatively and positively correlated with apnea hyponea index, respectively. In vitro intermittent hypoxia with re-oxygenation exposure to human THP-1/HUVEC cell lines resulted in LC3B/ATG5/ULK1/BECN1 down-regulations and p62 up-regulation along with increased apoptosis and oxidative stress, while rapamycin and umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem cell treatment reversed these abnormalities through de-methylation of the ATG5 gene promoter.\n",

      "Targeting skin barrier function in atopic dermatitis.\n",
      "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in the general population. Skin barrier dysfunction is the central abnormality leading to AD. The cause of skin barrier dysfunction is complex and rooted in genetic mutations, interactions between the immune pathway activation and epithelial cells, altered host defense mechanisms, as well as environmental influences that cause epithelial cell activation and release of alarmins (such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin) which can activate the type 2 immune pathway, including generation of IL-4 and IL-13, which induces defects in the skin barrier and increased allergic inflammation. These inflammatory pathways are further influenced by environmental factors including the microbiome (especially Staphylococcus aureus), air pollution, stress, and other factors. As such, AD is a syndrome involving multiple phenotypes, all of which have in common skin barrier dysfunction as a key contributing factor. Understanding mechanisms leading to skin barrier dysfunction in AD is pointing to the development of new topical and systemic treatments in AD that helps keep skin borders secure and effectively treat the disease.\n",

      "Understanding neuron-glia crosstalk and biological clocks in insomnia.\n",
      "According to the World Health Organization, about one-third of the population experiences insomnia symptoms, and about 10-15% suffer from chronic insomnia, the most common sleep disorder. Sleeping difficulties associated with insomnia are often linked to chronic sleep deprivation, which has a negative health impact partly due to disruption in the internal synchronisation of biological clocks. These are regulated by clock genes and modulate most biological processes. Most studies addressing circadian rhythm regulation have focused on the role of neurons, yet glial cells also impact circadian rhythms and sleep regulation. Chronic insomnia and sleep loss have been associated with glial cell activation, exacerbated neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, altered neuronal metabolism and synaptic plasticity, accelerated age-related processes and decreased lifespan. It is, therefore, essential to highlight the importance of glia-neuron interplay on sleep/circadian regulation and overall healthy brain function. Hence, in this review, we aim to address the main neurobiological mechanisms involved in neuron-glia crosstalk, with an emphasis on microglia and astrocytes, in both healthy sleep, chronic sleep deprivation and chronic insomnia.\n",

      "Effects of a Social Media-Based Mind-Body Intervention Embedded With Acupressure and Mindfulness for Stress Reduction Among Family Caregivers of Frail Older Adults: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.\n",
      "Family caregivers of frail older adults experience high levels of stress. Mind-body interventions (MBIs) focused on caregiver stress are often limited in teaching approaches, difficult to practice, and costly. A social media-based MBI embedded with mindfulness meditation (MM) and self-administered acupressure (SA) may be effective for family caregivers, offer greater usability, and lead to greater adherence.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to test the feasibility and preliminary effects of a social media-based MBI embedded with MM and SA on family caregivers of frail older adults and to investigate the preliminary effects of the intervention using a pilot randomized controlled trial.\n",
      "A 2-arm randomized controlled trial design was adopted. Family caregivers of frail older adults (n=64) were randomized into either the intervention group (n=32), receiving 8 weeks of social media-based MM and SA, or the control group (n=32), receiving brief education on caregiving for people with frailty. The primary outcome (caregiver stress) and secondary outcomes (caregiver burden, sleep quality, and mindfulness awareness and attention) were measured using a web-based survey at baseline (T0), immediately after the intervention (T1), and at the 3-month follow-up (T2).\n",
      "The feasibility of the intervention was established with a high attendance rate (87.5%), high usability score (79), and low attrition rate (1.6%). The generalized estimating equation results showed that participants in the intervention group at T1 and T2 experienced a significant improvement in stress reduction (P=.02 and P=.04, respectively), sleep quality (P=.004 and P=.01, respectively), and mindful awareness and attention (P=.006 and P=.02, respectively) compared with the control group. There were no substantial improvements in caregiver burden at T1 and T2 (P=.59 and P=.47, respectively). A focus group session conducted after the intervention had 5 themes: impact on the family caregivers, difficulty in practicing the intervention, the strength of the program, the limitations of the program, and perception of the intervention.\n",
      "The findings support the feasibility and preliminary effects of social media-based MBI embedded with acupressure and MM on reducing stress among family caregivers of frail older people and enhancing sleep quality and mindfulness levels. A future study with a larger and more diverse sample is proposed to evaluate the longer-term effects and generalizability of the intervention.\n",

      "Mediation analysis of circadian preferences and other behavioral and sociodemographic factors associated with subjective well-being in undergraduate students.\n",
      "Undergraduate students are usually subjected to a routine with constant pressure, stress, circadian misalignment, and sleep irregularity that impairs their subjective well-being. Recent evidence suggests that circadian preference is also a risk factor for impaired mental health and factors related to subjective well-being. This study aimed to identify the sociodemographic factors associated with subjective well-being and describe the mediating behavioral variables. Between September 2018 and March 2021, 615 Brazilian students enrolled in higher educational institutions completed an electronic form containing questionnaires on subjective well-being, sociodemographic, and behavioral-related factors (convenience sample). A statistical mediation model was applied to describe how these variables influence subjective well-being. We observed that Morningness (p < .001), identification with the male gender (p = .010), not working while studying (p = .048), and the practice of Pilates/yoga (p = .028) were associated with greater subjective well-being. Except for employment status, no direct effects were observed, which reinforces the need to consider a multidimensional approach. The relationship between subjective well-being and sociodemographic factors exists only in the presence of behavioral mediators, specifically perceived stress, daytime sleepiness, symptoms of depression, sleep quality, and positive and negative affects. Future work should investigate in more detail the impact of sleep, stress, and circadian preferences on this relationship.\n",

      "Effect of MBSR, DBT and CBT on the hypertension patients with depression/anxiety: Protocol of a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis.\n",
      "Hypertension, one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, usually requires lifetime managing blood pressure (BP) with medications. Due to quite large number of hypertension patients co-exist with depression and/or anxiety, and non-cooperated with medical instruction, consequently management of BP is impaired with serious complications, resulting in compromised quality of life. Consequently quality of life of such patients is impaired with serious complications. Therefore, management of depression and/or anxiety is equally important as the treatment of hypertension. Depression and/or anxiety are independent risk factors of hypertension, which is supported by the finding that there is close correlation between hypertension are depression/or anxiety. Psychotherapy (non-drug treatment) maybe useful for hypertensive patients with depression and/or anxiety to improve their negative emotions. We aim to quantify the effective of psychological therapies in the management of hypertension patients with depression or anxiety, by comparing and ranking a network meta-analysis (NMA).\n",
      "Literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be performed in five electronic databases from inception to December 2021, including PubMed, the Cochrane library, Embase, Web of Science, and China Biology Medicine disc (CBM). The search terms mainly include \"hypertension\", \"mindfulness-based stress reduction\" (MBSR), \"cognitive behavioral therapy\" (CBT) and \"dialectical behavior therapy\" (DBT). Cochrane Collaboration quality assessment tool will be used for the risk of bias assessment. A Bayesian network meta-analysis will be performed, using WinBUGS 1.4.3, and Stata 14 will be applied to draw the network diagram, while RevMan 5.3.5 will be used to produce funnel plot for assessing the risk of publication bias. Recommended rating, development and grade methodology will also be utilized to assess the quality of evidence.\n",
      "Effect of MBSR, CBT and DBT will be evaluated by traditional meta-analysis directly and Bayesian network meta-analysis indirectly. Our study will provide the evidence on the efficacy and safety of psychological treatments in the hypertension patients with anxiety. There is no research ethical requirement because this is a systematic review of published literature. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n",

      "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the general population and health care workers.\n",
      "The Health Sciences Foundation has assembled a multidisciplinary group around a series of questions about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the general population and specific groups within that population, particularly healthcare workers. In the general population, the most prevalent mental disorders have been anxiety, sleep disorders and affective disorders, primarily depression. There has been a considerable increase in suicidal behavior, especially in young women and men over 70 years of age. There has been an increase in alcohol abuse and nicotine, cannabis and cocaine use. In contrast, the use of synthetic stimulants during periods of confinement has decreased. With regard to non-substance addictions, gambling was very limited, pornography consumption increased significantly and there was an increase in compulsive shopping and the use of video games. Particularly vulnerable groups include adolescents and patients with autism spectrum disorders. Healthcare workers suffered an increase in depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress, especially those who were exposed during the early stages of the pandemic. Female sex, being a nurse, proximity to patients with COVID-19, working in a rural environment and having previous psychiatric or organic illnesses were some of the most frequently repeated factors in various studies in this population group. The media have shown a good degree of knowledge about these problems and have dealt with them frequently and from the point of view of ethics, crisis situations, such as the one experienced, have triggered not only physical but also moral claudications.\n",

      "The mental health of international students is a growing concern for education providers, students, and their families. Chinese international students have low rates of help seeking owing to language, stigma, and mental health literacy barriers. Web-based help-seeking interventions may improve the rate of help seeking among Chinese international students.\n",
      "This study aimed to describe the development of a mental well-being web app providing personalized feedback and tailored psychoeducation and resources to support help seeking among international university students whose first language is Chinese and test the web application's uptake and engagement.\n",
      "The bilingual MindYourHead web application contains 6 in-app assessments for various areas of mental health, and users are provided with personalized feedback on symptom severity, psychoeducation tailored to the person's symptoms and information about relevant interventions, and tailored links to external resources and mental health services. A feasibility study was conducted within a school at the University of Sydney to examine the uptake and engagement of the web application among Chinese international students and any demographic characteristics or help-seeking attitudes or intentions that were associated with its engagement.\n",
      "A total of 130 Chinese international students signed up on the web application. There was an uptake of 13.4% (122/908) in the schools' Chinese student enrollment. Most participants (76/130, 58.5%) preferred to use the web application in Chinese and used informal but not formal help for their mental health. There was considerable attrition owing to a design issue, and only 46 students gained access to the full content of the web application. Of these, 67% (31/46) of participants completed 1 or more of the in-app mental well-being assessments. The most commonly engaged in-app assessments were distress (23/31, 74%), stress (17/31, 55%), and sleep (15/31, 48%), with the majority scoring within the moderate- or high-risk level of the score range. In total, 10% (9/81) of the completed in-app assessments led to clicks to external resources or services. No demographic or help-seeking intentions or attitudes were associated with web-application engagement.\n",
      "There were promising levels of demand, uptake, and engagement with the MindYourHead web application. The web application appears to attract students who wished to access mental health information in their native language, those who had poor mental health in the past but relied on informal support, and those who were at moderate or high risk of poor mental well-being. Further research is required to explore ways to improve uptake and engagement and to test the efficacy of the web application on Chinese international students' mental health literacy, stigma, and help seeking.\n",

Our objective was to determine the relationship between OSA and the periodontal condition and its associated local and systemic risk factors.\n",
      "This was an observational case-control study involving 60 patients. Local oral risk factors and the systemic condition of each patient were evaluated. All patients underwent polysomnography for the diagnosis of OSA. Chi-squared, one-way ANOVA, and Bonferroni's tests were performed.\n",
      "A higher percentage of patients with periodontitis had severe OSA (66.66%); however, no statistically significant association was found between the two pathologies (p = 0.290). In terms of systemic risk factors, an association was found between arterial hypertension and severe OSA (p = 0.038), and in terms of local factors, an association was found between the use of removable prostheses and severe OSA (p = 0.0273).\n",
      "In the general population, patients with periodontitis showed a higher prevalence of severe OSA. Obesity and hypothyroidism were the most prevalent systemic findings in patients with OSA and periodontitis. Arterial hypertension and osteoarthritis were found to be associated with severe OSA.

      "Associations between prenatal earthquake exposure and children's mental health remain unclear. Moreover, there is a paucity of research using quasi-experimental statistical techniques to diminish potential selection bias. Thus, this study aimed to explore the impact of prenatal exposure to the Chilean earthquake of 2010 on children's behavioural and emotional problems between 1½ and 3 years old using propensity score matching.\n",
      "Participants included 1549 families from the Encuesta Longitudinal de la Primera Infancia cohort in Chile. Maternal reports using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) were used to assess behavioural and emotional problems between 1½ and 3 years old. Information on prenatal earthquake exposure was collected via maternal report. The Kernel matching estimator was used to compare the average treatment effects of children who were exposed to the earthquake compared to those who were not.\n",
      "Five of the seven CBCL outcomes were statistically significant after matching and adjustment for multiple testing, suggesting greater difficulties for exposed children which included emotional reactivity, anxious/depressed, sleep problems, attention problems, and aggression (mean difference of 0.69, 0.87, 0.73, 0.85, 3.51, respectively). The magnitude of the effect was small to medium.\n",
      "Findings contribute to the potential causal inferences between prenatal earthquake exposure and increased behavioural and emotional problems in early childhood. Results suggest that in utero experiences may have long-term consequences for infants' well-being, supporting the need for specific interventions in pregnancy after natural disasters.\n",

      "Hypothalamic OXT (Oxytocin) Neuron Activation Attenuates Intermittent Hypoxia-Induced Hypertension and Cardiac Dysfunction in an Animal Model of Sleep Apnea.\n",
      "Obstructive sleep apnea is a prevalent and poorly treated cardiovascular disease that leads to hypertension and autonomic imbalance. Recent studies that restore cardiac parasympathetic tone using selective activation of hypothalamic OXT (oxytocin) neurons have shown beneficial cardiovascular outcomes in animal models of cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to determine if chemogenetic activation of hypothalamic OXT neurons in animals with existing obstructive sleep apnea-induced hypertension would reverse or blunt the progression of autonomic and cardiovascular dysfunction.\n",
      "Two groups of rats were exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a model of obstructive sleep apnea, for 4 weeks to induce hypertension. During an additional 4 weeks of exposure to CIH, 1 group was treated with selective activation of hypothalamic OXT neurons while the other group was untreated.\n",
      "Hypertensive animals exposed to CIH and treated with daily hypothalamic OXT neuron activation had lower blood pressure, faster heart rate recovery times after exercise, and improved indices of cardiac function compared with untreated hypertensive animals. Microarray analysis suggested that, compared with treated animals, untreated animals had gene expression profiles associated with cellular stress response activation, hypoxia-inducible factor stabilization, and myocardial extracellular matrix remodeling and fibrosis.\n",
      "In animals already presenting with CIH-induced hypertension, chronic activation of hypothalamic OXT neurons blunted the progression of hypertension and conferred cardioprotection after an additional 4 weeks of CIH exposure. These results have significant clinical translation for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.\n",

      "Course of child social-emotional and sleep symptoms, parental distress and pandemic-related stressors during COVID-19.\n",
      "Research on the longitudinal courses of child social-emotional symptoms and sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic within societies would be of key value for promoting child well-being in global crises. We characterized the course of children's social-emotional and sleep symptoms before and throughout the pandemic in a Finnish longitudinal cohort of 1825 5- to 9-year-old children (46% girls) with four follow-up points during the pandemic from up to 695 participants (spring 2020-summer 2021). Second, we examined the role of parental distress and COVID-related stressful events in child symptoms. Child total and behavioral symptoms increased in spring 2020 but decreased thereafter and remained stable throughout the rest of the follow-up. Sleep symptoms decreased in spring 2020 and remained stable thereafter. Parental distress was linked with higher child social-emotional and sleep symptoms. The cross-sectional associations between COVID-related stressors and child symptoms were partially mediated by parental distress. The findings propose that children can be protected from the long-term adverse influences of the pandemic, and parental well-being likely plays a mediating role between pandemic-related stressors and child well-being. Further research focusing on the societal and resilience factors underlying family and child responses to the pandemic is warranted.\n",

      "To investigate the links between adolescent migraine and comorbid and co-occurring conditions using a large, nationally representative longitudinal study.\n",
      "Comorbidities and co-occurring conditions play an important role in the clinical treatment of individuals with migraine. Research in this area has focused largely on the adult population using cross-sectional data, but less is known about adolescents and how conditions may co-occur over time from a broader developmental perspective. The goals of this manuscript were to empirically evaluate the associations between adolescent migraine and several linked conditions and explore the relative timings of onset of these conditions from adolescence to adulthood.\n",
      "Data came from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a school-based study of the health-related behaviors and conditions of adolescents. The present study examined data from Wave 1 (W1, study years: 1994-1995), Wave 4 (W4, study years: 2008-2009), and Wave 5 (W5, study years: 2016-2018). Analyses and visual plots were used to evaluate potential links between parent-reported adolescent migraine status (PR-AdMig) at W1 and 15 medical conditions identified based on self-reported medical diagnoses (SR-MDs) at W4 and W5. Based on prior literature in adults, we identified 11 conditions predicted to be associated with PR-AdMig and four conditions predicted not to be associated with PR-AdMig. The analyses were exploratory and post hoc.\n",
      "The total sample size pooling over all analyses was n = 13,786, but the wave-specific sample sizes differed due to missing data (W4 analyses, n = 12,692; W5 analyses, n = 10,340); 7243/13,786 (unweighted: 52.5%; weighted: 50.5%) of participants were female, 7640/13,786 (unweighted: 55.4%; weighted: 68.6%) were White, and 1580/13,786 (unweighted: 11.5%; weighted: 12.0%) had PR-AdMig. The average ages were 15.8 years at W1, 28.7 years at W4, and 37.8 years at W5. Findings showed that PR-AdMig was associated with anxiety/panic disorder (W4: PR-AdMig vs. Control weighted %: 17.1% vs. 12.6%, unadjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.74, p = 0.0003; W5: 31.6% vs. 22.4%, OR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.28-2.02, p < 0.0001), asthma/chronic bronchitis/emphysema (W4: 20.0% vs. 14.7%, OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.20-1.76, p < 0.001; W5: 21.0% vs. 14.6%, OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.25-1.94, p < 0.001), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (W4: 8.3% vs. 5.4%, OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.18-2.10, p = 0.002), depression (W4: 23.7% vs. 15.4%, OR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.43-2.04, p < 0.0001; W5: 33.8% vs. 25.1%, OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.22-1.90, p < 0.001), epilepsy/seizure disorder (W4: 2.2% vs. 1.2%, OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.23-2.76, p = 0.004), migraine (W4: 38.8% vs. 11.9%, OR = 4.7, 95% CI 4.1-5.5, p < 0.001), post-traumatic stress disorder (W4: 4.1% vs. 2.8%, OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.01-2.08, p = 0.042; W5: 11.3% vs. 7.1%, OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.27-2.20, p < 0.001), and sleep apnea (W5: 11.0% vs. 7.6%, OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.15-1.98, p = 0.003). Among theoretically unlinked conditions, only hepatitis C at W4 was shown to have a relationship with adolescent onset migraine (0.7% vs. 0.2%, OR = 3.63, 95% CI 1.32-10.0, p = 0.013). Visual plots suggested that the retrospective, self-report timing of onset of specific subsets of co-occurring conditions tended to group together over time.\n",

      "Modeling integrated stress, sleep, fear and neuroimmune responses: Relevance for understanding trauma and stress-related disorders.\n",
      "Sleep and stress have complex interactions that are implicated in both physical diseases and psychiatric disorders. These interactions can be modulated by learning and memory, and involve additional interactions with the neuroimmune system. In this paper, we propose that stressful challenges induce integrated responses across multiple systems that can vary depending on situational variables in which the initial stress was experienced, and with the ability of the individual to cope with stress- and fear-inducing challenges. Differences in coping may involve differences in resilience and vulnerability and/or whether the stressful context allows adaptive learning and responses. We provide data demonstrating both common (corticosterone, SIH and fear behaviors) and distinguishing (sleep and neuroimmune) responses that are associated with an individual's ability to respond and relative resilience and vulnerability. We discuss neurocircuitry regulating integrated stress, sleep, neuroimmune and fear responses, and show that responses can be modulated at the neural level. Finally, we discuss factors that need to be considered in models of integrated stress responses and their relevance for understanding stress-related disorders in humans.\n",

      "Research conducted over the past several decades has revolutionized our understanding of the role of the immune system in neural and psychological development and function across the life span. Our goal in this review is to introduce this dynamic area of research to a psychological audience and highlight its relevance for clinical psychology. We begin by introducing the basic physiology of immune-to-brain signaling and the neuroimmune network, focusing on inflammation. Drawing from preclinical and clinical research, we then examine effects of immune activation on key psychological domains, including positive and negative valence systems, social processes, cognition, and arousal (fatigue, sleep), as well as links with psychological disorders (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia).

      "In-Theater Mental Health Disorders Among U.S. Soldiers Deployed Between 2008 and 2013.\n",
      "Deployed service members regularly undergo demanding and stressful experiences that can contribute to mental health difficulties; however, there is a scarcity of studies examining rates of mental health disorders in-theater. The current study examined case rates of mental health disorders among deployed U.S. Army Soldiers using diagnostic encounter data from the Theater Medical Data Store. Case rates were calculated across 12 categories of mental health disorders. While in theater, soldiers' highest rates were for stress reactions and adjustment disorders, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. The lowest rates in theater were for psychosis, bipolar, somatic, and eating disorders. Notably, female soldiers had higher rates than their male counterparts for disorders in each of the 12 diagnostic categories. Results provide crucial information to aid in decision making about necessary interventions and provider competencies in deployed settings. Knowledge gained from these data may improve force readiness, help lessen disease burden, and inform military policy and prevention efforts.\n",

      "We review the literature on sleep in extreme environments. Accordingly, we present a model that identifies the need for mitigating interventions to preserve sleep quality for military deployments.\n",
      "Situational factors that affect sleep in extreme environments include cold temperatures, isolated and confined areas, fluctuating seasonality, photoperiodicity, and extreme latitudes and altitudes. Results vary across studies, but general effects include decreased total sleep time, poor sleep efficiency, and non-specific phase delays or phase advances in sleep onset and sleep architecture. Considering habitability measures (e.g., light or temperature control) and individual differences such as variable stress responses or sleep need can mitigate these effects to improve mood, cognition, and operational performance. Although the situational demands during military missions inevitably reduce total sleep time and sleep efficiency, mitigating factors can attenuate sleep-related impairments, hence allowing for optimal mission success and personnel safety.\n",

Overall hospital stress was highly correlated with ICU stress (ρ = 0.82; p < 0.0001) but only moderately correlated with ED stress (ρ = 0.52; p < 0.0001). A county increase in 10 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 cases per 100,000 residents was associated with an increase in the odds of overall hospital, ICU, and ED stress by 9% (95% CI, 5-12%), 7% (3-10%), and 4% (2-6%), respectively. During the Delta variant surge, overall hospital stress persisted for a median of 11.5 weeks (interquartile range, 9-14 wk) after local case peak. ICU stress had a similar pattern of resolution (median 11 wk [6-14 wk] after local case peak; p = 0.59) while the resolution of ED stress (median 6 wk [5-6 wk] after local case peak; p = 0.003) was earlier.

      "Sperm DNA damage: The possible link between obesity and male infertility, an update of the current literature.\n",
      "Obesity prevalence worldwide is increasing significantly. Whilst maternal obesity has clear detrimental impacts on fertility, pregnancy and foetal outcomes, more recently there has been an increasing focus on the role of paternal obesity in human fertility. Recent meta-analyses have indicated that obesity in men negatively affects basic sperm parameters such as sperm count, concentration and motility, increases the incidence of infertility and reduces the chances of conception. Sperm DNA damage, typically characterised by DNA strand breaks and oxidation of DNA nucleotides, is a specialised marker of sperm quality that has been independently associated with recurrent miscarriage, reduced assisted reproduction success and increased mutational loads in subsequent offspring. Whilst, there are still conflicting data in humans as to the association of obesity in men with sperm DNA damage, evidence from rodent models is clear, indicating that male obesity increases sperm DNA damage. Human data are often conflicting because of the large heterogeneity amongst studies, the use of body mass index as the indicator of obesity and the methods used for detection of sperm DNA damage. Furthermore, comorbidities of obesity (i.e., heat stress, adipokines, insulin resistance, changes in lipids, hypogonadism and obstructive sleep apnoea) are also independently associated with increased sperm DNA damage that is not always modified in men with obesity, and as such may provide a causative link to the discrepancies amongst human studies. In this review, we provide an update on the literature regarding the associations between obesity in men and fertility, basic sperm parameters and sperm DNA damage. We further discuss potential reasons for the discrepancies in the literature and outline possible direct and indirect mechanisms of increased sperm DNA damage resulting from obesity. Finally, we summarise intergenerational obesity through the paternal linage and how sperm DNA damage may contribute to the transmission.\n",

      "Exploring Influencing Factors of Anxiety Improvement Following Mindfulness-Based Music Therapy in Young Adults with Cancer.\n",
      "The purpose of this secondary analysis was to explore physiological, psychological, and situational influencing factors that may affect the impact of a mindfulness-music therapy intervention on anxiety severity in young adults receiving cancer treatment. Young adults receiving cancer treatment for ≥ eight weeks were recruited from adult and pediatric oncology outpatient centers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Participants were asked to attend up to four, in-person (offered virtually via Zoom video conference after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic) 45-min mindfulness-based music therapy sessions over twelve weeks with a board-certified music therapist. Participants completed questionnaires about anxiety, stress, and other cancer treatment-related outcomes before and after participating in the intervention. Changes in anxiety (i.e., PROMIS Anxiety 4a) over time were compared among baseline physiological (e.g., age or sex), psychological (e.g., stress), and situational influencing (i.e., intervention delivery format) factors using Wilcoxon-rank sum tests. Thirty-one of the 37 enrolled participants completed the baseline and post-intervention measures and were eligible for inclusion in the secondary analysis. Results revealed that higher baseline physical functioning (median change = -6.65), anxiety (median change=-5.65), fatigue (median change = -5.6), sleep disturbance (median change = -5.6), female sex (median change = -5.15), or virtual intervention delivery (median change = -4.65) were potential physiological, psychological, or situational influencing factors associated with anxiety improvement following mindfulness-based music therapy. Additional investigation into physiological, psychological, or situational influencing factors associated with anxiety response will help to tailor the design of future mindfulness-music therapy interventions to decrease psychological distress and address the unique psychosocial concerns among young adults receiving cancer treatment.

      "The Interaction Effect of Sleep Deprivation and Treadmill Exercise in Various Durations on Spatial Memory with Respect to the Oxidative Status of Rats.\n",
      "Sleep deprivation (SD) has deleterious effects on cognitive functions including learning and memory. However, some studies have shown that SD can improve cognitive functions. Interestingly, treadmill exercise has both impairment and improvement effects on memory function. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of SD for 4 (short-term) and 24 (long-term) hours, and two protocols of treadmill exercise (mild short-term and moderate long-term) on spatial memory performance, and oxidative and antioxidant markers in the serum of rats. Morris Water Maze apparatus was used to assess spatial memory performance. Also, SD was done using gentle handling method. In addition, the serum level of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was measured. The results showed that 24 h SD (but not 4 h) had negative effect on spatial memory performance, decreased SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px level, and increased MDA level. Long-term moderate (but not short-term mild) treadmill exercise had also negative effect on spatial memory performance, decreased SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px level, and increased MDA level. Interestingly, both protocols of treadmill exercise reversed spatial memory impairment and oxidative stress induced by 24 h SD. In conclusion, it seems that SD and treadmill exercise interact with each other, and moderate long-term exercise can reverse the negative effects of long-term SD on memory and oxidative status; although, it disrupted memory function and increased oxidative stress by itself.\n",

      "College students often face challenges and obstacles which leads them vulnerable to burnout. Though numerous studies have supported an association between mindfulness and burnout, yet little is known about the potential mediating role of mindfulness exerts its effect in this link. This study aimed to explore the relationship between mindfulness and burnout among Chinese college students and investigated the sleep quality and perceived stress as two potential mediators of that relationship. A total of 536 college students (mean age = 21.93, 66.2% female) were investigated and completed the Five Facet of Mindfulness Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Perceived Stress Scale and Academic Burnout Scale of College Students. Path analyses were employed to examine the mediating effect. Results indicated that mindfulness had significant negative correlation with burnout (r=-.584, p < 0.001). Sleep quality and perceived stress were significant mediators of the observed relationship between mindfulness and burnout. These findings shed light upon the mediating role of sleep quality and perceived stress, and suggest that college students' mindfulness may facilitate their sleep quality and decrease perceived stress, which, in turn, may help prevent and reduce burnout.\n",

      "Current models of insomnia disorder: a theoretical review on the potential role of the orexinergic pathway with implications for insomnia treatment.\n",
      "Insomnia disorder is considered as a stress-related disorder associated with hyperarousal, stress and emotion dysregulation and the instability of the 'flip-flop' switch system. The orexinergic system is well known for its key role in sleep and arousal processes but also in the allostatic system regulating stress and emotions and may thus be of major interest for insomnia and its treatment. Accordingly, we discuss the potential role of orexins on sleep processes, brain systems modulating stress and emotions with potential implications for insomnia pathophysiology. We reviewed available data on the effect of dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) on sleep and brain systems modulating stress/emotions with implications for insomnia treatment. We present our findings as a narrative review. Few data in animals and humans have reported that disrupted sleep and insomnia may be related to the overactivation of orexinergic system, while some more consistent data in humans and animals reported the overactivation of orexins in response to acute stress and in stress-related disorders. Taken together these findings may let us hypothesise that an orexins overactivation may be associated with stress-related hyperarousal and the hyperactivation of arousal-promoting systems in insomnia. On the other hand, it is possible that by rebalancing orexins with DORAs we may regulate both sleep and allostatic systems, in turn, contributing to a 'switch off' of hyperarousal in insomnia. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to clarify the role of the orexin system in insomnia and to evaluate the effects of DORAs on sleep, stress and emotions regulating systems.\n",

      "Feasibility and acceptability of mobile methods to assess home and neighborhood environments related to adolescent sleep.\n",
      "A growing evidence base suggests home and neighborhood environmental exposures may influence adolescent sleep, but few studies have assessed these relationships using methods that account for time-varying, location-specific exposures, or multiple neighborhood contexts. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using smartphone global positioning system (GPS) tracking and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess time-varying home and neighborhood environmental exposures hypothesized to be associated with adolescent sleep.\n",
      "Adolescents aged 15-17 years in Philadelphia completed 7 days of continuous smartphone GPS tracking, which was used to identify daily levels of exposure to geocoded neighborhood factors (eg, crime, green space). Four daily EMA surveys assessed home sleep environment (eg, noise, light), stress, health behaviors, and neighborhood perceptions. Feasibility and acceptability of GPS tracking and EMA were assessed, and distributions of daily environmental exposures were examined.\n",
      "Among 25 teens (mean age 16, 56% male), there was a high level of GPS location data captured (median daily follow-up: 24 hours). Seventy-eight percent of EMA surveys were completed overall. Most participants (96%) reported no privacy concerns related to GPS tracking and minimal burden from EMA surveys. Exposures differed between participants' home neighborhoods and locations visited outside the home neighborhood (eg, higher crime away from home). Sleep environment disruptions were present on 29% of nights (most common: uncomfortable temperature) and were reported by 52% of adolescents.\n",

      "Understanding the Impact of Insufficient Sleep in Children with Behavior Problems on Caregiver Stress: Results from a U.S. National Study.\n",
      "Research indicates strong connections between child ADHD, child ODD/CD, and sleep. Children experiencing these concerns also have caregivers who report feeling more stress. However, no studies have examined how child ADHD and ODD/CD interact together and with insufficient sleep to potentially exacerbate caregiver stress. Data were acquired from the 2018/2019 National Survey of Children's Health, a nationally representative survey of parents or caregivers conducted across the United States (U.S.). The current study used data for children 6-17 years old with a final analytic sample size of 41,541, representing a total of 47,357,862 U.S. youth. Overall child ADHD and ODD/CD were each uniquely associated with increased caregiver stress, while adequate child sleep duration was related to decreased caregiver stress. However, these findings were qualified by a significant two-way interaction that revealed that caregiver stress among children with comorbid ADHD and ODD/CD was not significantly greater than that of children with ODD/CD alone. Significant interactions between sleep and ODD/CD on caregiver stress were generally not observed, except potentially in females with ADHD. Our findings underscore the importance of considering strategies to reduce both youth symptoms and caregiver stress simultaneously. Additionally, ensuring adequate sleep for all children is recommended.\n",

      "Belching disorders seriously affect quality of life; however, their prevalences and risk factors remain unknown. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors, particularly lifestyle factors, of belching disorders among freshman college students in central China.\n",
      "A cross-sectional study was conducted in September 2019 in Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, Hubei Province, China). The subjects were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire for data collection, including sociodemographic information, lifestyle factors, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Belching disorder was diagnosed based on the Rome IV criteria. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the risk factors for belching disorders.\n",
      "A total of 3335 subjects were enrolled, and 78.26% were men. Among them, 1.95% (65/3335) reported belching disorders. Significant differences in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Student-Life Stress Inventory (SLSI) scores, and consumption of whole grains, black tea, coffee were found between the belching and non-belching groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that coffee consumption at least once weekly and a high total SLSI score (over mean + standard deviation) were independent risk factors for belching disorders, while intake of whole grains at least once weekly was a protective factor.\n",
      "Excessive belching is a common disorder among freshman college students in central China. Lifestyle factors, including consumption of whole grains and coffee, and stress, were associated with belching disorders. Therefore, dietary intervention may be a potential management for belching disorders.\n",

      "How sleep disturbance is associated with Chinese police officers' job satisfaction: A moderated mediation model.\n",
      "Tasked with a wide variety of duties, police officers often encounter stressful situations and suffer from sleep disturbance. Previous studies have found that police officers with sleep disturbance generally reported lower levels of job satisfaction; however, the psychological mechanisms by which sleep disturbance is associated with job satisfaction are still relatively underexplored. This study investigated how sleep disturbance was associated with job satisfaction via the mediation of job involvement and via the moderation of resilience among police officers. Data from a sample of 827 Chinese police officers (86.9% men) was analysed. Participants completed a written questionnaire assessing sleep disturbance, job satisfaction, job involvement, resilience, and demographic information. A moderated mediation model was conducted to examine the research questions. Sleep disturbance was negatively associated with job involvement, which, in turn, was positively associated with job satisfaction. Furthermore, both direct and indirect effects of sleep disturbance on job satisfaction were moderated by resilience. Specifically, the negative association between sleep disturbance and job satisfaction was significant only for those with low levels of resilience, but not for those with high levels of resilience. In addition, the positive association between job involvement and job satisfaction was stronger for those with higher resilience compared with those with lower resilience. The findings advance understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying the association between sleep disturbance and job satisfaction among police officers.\n",

      "Given that the stages of sleep have specific brainwave patterns, it may be feasible to manipulate brainwaves to induce stages of sleep to improve better sleep quality. Binaural beat frequencies (BBFs) are an auditory-neurologic technique that uses auditory tones \n",
      "This protocol uses a two cohort unblinded and double-blinded, randomized, pre- and post-intervention methods and crossover matched group design. In Cohort 1, a sample of 106 participants with poor sleep quality will be randomized into two groups. All participants will start with 1 week of no intervention. Group 1 will use theta/delta BBF for 2 weeks followed by 1 week of no intervention followed by music for 2 weeks. Group 2 will do the reverse. In Cohort 2, 62 participants will be blinded and randomized into two groups. Group 3 will use music for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week break followed by music embedded with theta/delta BBF for 2 weeks. Group 4 will do the reverse. Using Cohort 1 music only as a control, data will be collected using sleep actigraphy, sleep quality questionnaires, and sleep diaries with a crossover and match group analysis between cohorts to compare the effect of no intervention vs. music vs. BBF only vs. music with BBF on sleep quality.\n",
      "Phase 1 concluded that theta BBF was able to decrease stress to help induce sleep. Phase 2 will assess if theta and delta BBFs, with breaks to allow for REM, will be able to sustain sleep to improve sleep efficiency. The data from Phase 1 and 2 will provide information to help construct an all-night audio program with the appropriate BBF and timing to trigger the correct sleep stage for better sleep efficiency. If this concept is feasible, it could be beneficial for many sleep disorders.\n",

      "Brain function effects of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) video viewing.\n",
      "Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is the sensation of tingling from audiovisual stimuli that leads to positive emotions. ASMR is used among young people to relax, induce sleep, reduce stress, and alleviate anxiety. However, even without experiencing tingling, ASMR is used by many young people to seek relaxation. Auditory stimulation in ASMR is thought to play the most important role among its triggers, and previous studies have used a mixture of auditory and visual stimulation and auditory stimulation. This is the first study to approach the differences between the effects of direct audiovisual and auditory stimulation from the perspective of brain function using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and to clarify the effects of ASMR, which attracts many young people.\n",
      "The subjects were 30 healthy subjects over 19 years old or older who had not experienced tingling. Brain function was imaged by fMRI while watching ASMR videos or listening to the sound files only. We administered a questionnaire based on a Likert scale to determine if the participants felt a \"relaxed mood\" and \"tingling mood\" during the task.\n",
      "Significant activation was found in the visual cortex for audiovisual stimulation and in the visual and auditory cortex for auditory stimulation. In addition, activation of characteristic sites was observed. The specific sites of activation for audiovisual stimulation were the middle frontal gyrus and the left nucleus accumbens, while the specific sites of activation for auditory stimulation were the bilateral insular cortices. The questionnaire showed no significant differences in either \"relaxed mood\" or \"tingling mood\" in response to auditory and visual stimulation or auditory stimulation alone.\n",
      "The results of this study showed that there was a clear difference between auditory and audiovisual stimulation in terms of the areas of activation in the brain, but the questionnaire did not reveal any difference in the subjects' mood. Audiovisual stimulation showed activation of the middle frontal gyrus and the nucleus accumbens, whereas auditory stimulation showed activation of the insular cortex. This difference in brain activation sites suggests a difference in mental health effects between auditory and audiovisual stimulation. However, future research on comparisons between those who experience tingling and those who do not, as well as investigations of physiological indices, and examination of the relationship with activated areas in the brain may show that ASMR is useful for mental health.\n",

      "Agarwood essential oil inhalation exerts antianxiety and antidepressant effects via the regulation of Glu/GABA system homeostasis.\n",
      "Depression and anxiety are common diseases that endanger the physical and mental health of individuals. Agarwood incense inhalation has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for relaxation and to improve sleep for centuries. In a previous study by the authors it was demonstrated that agarwood essential oil (AEO) injection exerted anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. Therefore the present study further investigated the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of AEO inhalation on anxiolytic mice induced by M-chlorophenylpiperazine and depressive mice induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress. The results demonstrated that AEO exerted a significant anxiolytic effect, whereby autonomous movements were inhibited during the light dark exploration test and open field test. Furthermore, the tail suspension test and the forced swimming test demonstrated that AEO also exerted an antidepressant effect, whereby the immobility times were decreased. Moreover, AEO was determined to increase the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor (GABA\n",

      "Therapeutic effects of melatonin on endometriosis, targeting molecular pathways: Current knowledge and future perspective.\n",
      "Endometriosis, the very serious disease in women creates a huge financial burden worldwide, which is comparable to diabetes mellitus. In addition to the typical pelvic pain, endometriosis is related to low life quality and decreased work efficiency; clinical consequences include mood complaints, metabolic impairments, inflammation, immunologic problems, and elevated malignancy risks. Several risk factors are correlated with endometriosis including elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress, long-lasting inflammation, raised immune tolerance, as well as autoimmunity. Melatonin is a natural molecule present throughout both the plant and animal kingdoms. It has numerous functions as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Due to the anti-proliferative, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-invasive features of melatonin, it performances as a beneficial agent to limit endometriosis; this involves several pathways including antiestrogenic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptosis effects, as well as reducing the growth of E2-induced endometriotic tissue. Moreover, melatonin can favor sleep quality and decrease the unwanted signs in the patients. However, most of the data on melatonin accured from experimental works and additional clinical trials are needed. This review summarizes what is currently known regarding the influence of melatonin on endometriosis. AVAILABILITY OF DATA AND MATERIAL: Not applicable.\n",

      "There were limited studies that have probed into the combined effect of the cortisol/testosterone (C/T) ratio as a biomarker of stress and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) on coronary heart disease (CHD). This research aimed to explore the association of C/T ratio and PSQI with the risk of CHD in a rural Chinese population, as well as the interaction and combined effect between C/T ratio and PSQI on CHD.\n",
      "A case-control study was performed including 307 individuals without CHD and 307 patients drawn from Henan Rural Cohort. Logistic regression was utilized to survey the independent and joint effects of the C/T ratio and PSQI on CHD.

      "Mediterranean-Style Diet and Other Determinants of Well-Being in Omnivorous, Vegetarian, and Vegan Women.\n",
      "Due to the lack of studies comparing the determinants of well-being in omnivores and vegetarians, we examined associations of socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, including adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet, in relation to well-being in omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan women. Well-being was assessed using a validated WHO-5 Well-Being Index. Adherence to the Mediterranean-style diet was determined using a modified Mediterranean diet score. The study was conducted on 636 women (23.9 ± 5.7 years), of whom 47.3% were omnivores, 33.2% vegetarians, and 19.5% vegans. The good well-being group (WHO-5 Index ≥ 13 points) comprised 30.9% of the omnivores, 46.0% of the vegetarians, and 57.3% of the vegans. The remaining participants were classified as belonging to the poor well-being group (<13 points). Compared to the omnivores, the vegetarians and vegans had a 1.6-fold (95% CI: 1.04-2.42) and a 2.4-fold (95% CI: 1.45-3.99) higher probability of having good well-being, respectively. In omnivores, the predictors of good well-being were adherence to the Mediterranean-style diet (a 1-score increment was associated with a 17% higher probability of good well-being, P-trend = 0.016), higher self-perceived health status, and lower levels of stress. In vegetarians and vegans, it was older age, higher physical activity (≥3 h/week), 7-8 h sleep time, and similarly to omnivores' higher self-perceived health status and lower stress level. Our findings indicate that following a Mediterranean-style diet was associated with better well-being in omnivores. Furthermore, we identified that different determinants were associated with well-being in omnivorous and vegetarian and vegan women.\n",

      "Integrative and Mechanistic Approach to the Hair Growth Cycle and Hair Loss.\n",
      "The hair cycle is composed of four primary phases: anagen, catagen, telogen, and exogen. Anagen is a highly mitotic phase characterized by the production of a hair shaft from the hair follicle, whereas catagen and telogen describe regression and the resting phase of the follicle, respectively, ultimately resulting in hair shedding. While 9% of hair follicles reside in telogen at any time, a variety of factors promote anagen to telogen transition, including inflammation, hormones, stress, nutritional deficiency, poor sleep quality, and cellular division inhibiting medication. Conversely, increased blood flow, direct stimulation of the hair follicle, and growth factors promote telogen to anagen transition and subsequent hair growth. This review seeks to comprehensively describe the hair cycle, anagen and telogen balance, factors that promote anagen to telogen transition and vice versa, and the clinical utility of a variety of lab testing and evaluations. Ultimately, a variety of factors impact the hair cycle, necessitating a holistic approach to hair loss.\n",

      "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent, underdiagnosed disease and is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, depression, accidents, and stroke. Recent clinical practice guidelines for OSA expressed the need for a new clinical tool that establishes the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) to determine the disease burden. The serum and plasma concentrations of Osteoprotegerin (OPG), Chitinase 3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), and Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) in 80 subjects-52 OSA patients, 27 moderate (15 ≤ AHI ˂ 30) and 25 severe (AHI ≥ 30), and 28 non-OSA controls (AHI 0-5)-were determined. Moreover, the Total Oxidative Status (TOS), Total Antioxidative Status (TAS), and Oxidative Stress Index (OSI) were assessed in the serum and plasma to evaluate whether the severity of OSA and the concentrations of OPG, YKL-40, and CT-1 correlate with the oxidative/reductive status. The serum and plasma concentrations of YKL-40 and CT-1 were higher in the OSA group, whereas the serum and plasma concentrations of OPG were lower compared to the control group. The concentrations of OPG, YKL-40, and CT-1 in the serum and plasma correlated with AHI; however, a better correlation of the concentrations was obtained for the above-mentioned proteins in the plasma. The concentrations of YKL-40 and CT-1 in the serum and OPG in the plasma show better diagnostic capabilities for moderate and severe OSA than the concentrations of YKL-40 and CT-1 in the plasma and the concentrations of OPG in the serum.\n",

      "Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Putative Contributions of Mineralocorticoid Receptors.\n",
      "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic and highly prevalent condition that is associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, leading to endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and vascular insulin resistance, resulting in increased cardiovascular disease and overall mortality rates. To date, OSA remains vastly underdiagnosed and undertreated, with conventional treatments yielding relatively discouraging results for improving cardiovascular outcomes in OSA patients. As such, a better mechanistic understanding of OSA-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the development of novel adjuvant therapeutic targets are critically needed. It is well-established that inappropriate mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation in cardiovascular tissues plays a causal role in a multitude of CVD states. Clinical studies and experimental models of OSA lead to increased secretion of the MR ligand aldosterone and excessive MR activation. Furthermore, MR activation has been associated with worsened OSA prognosis. Despite these documented relationships, there have been no studies exploring the causal involvement of MR signaling in OSA-associated CVD. Further, scarce clinical studies have exclusively assessed the beneficial role of MR antagonists for the treatment of systemic hypertension commonly associated with OSA. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of overlapping mechanistic pathways recruited in the context of MR activation- and OSA-induced CVD and propose MR-targeted therapy as a potential avenue to abrogate the deleterious cardiovascular consequences of OSA.\n",

      "Sleep of inadequate quantity and quality is increasing in the present 24 h society, with a negative impact on physical and mental health. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) generate a state of calm behavior that can reduce hyperactivity and improve sleep. We hypothesized that our specific MBI, administered online, may improve sleep quality and foster emotion regulation and mindfulness. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI), Arousal Predisposition Scale (APS), Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used to measure sleep quality and stability. Emotion regulation and mindfulness were measured via the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Our MBI included 12 biweekly integral meditation (IM) classes, recorded IM training for individual practice, and dietary advice to promote sleep regulation. Fifty-six voluntary poor sleepers with a PSQI score of >5 were randomly allocated to treated (\n",

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in stress, anxiety, and depression levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on possible awake and sleep bruxism prevalence and on the psychological factors associated with bruxism, comparing pre-pandemic, pandemic/lockdown, and post-pandemic samples of first-year students. A total of 274 dentistry students from the Complutense University of Madrid participated in the study: 92 from 2018/2019 (pre-pandemic), 90 from 2020/2021 (pandemic), and 92 students from 2021/2022 (post-pandemic) academic years. The participants filled out a thorough battery of validated questionnaires evaluating bruxism and different psychological characteristics, such as anxiety, depression, somatization, personality, and stress coping styles. While sleep bruxism prevalence was significantly higher for the pandemic group, awake bruxism was smaller in comparison to pre-pandemic and post-pandemic groups. The post-pandemic group also presented higher levels of neuroticism and agreeableness personality traits, and positive reappraisal than the pre-pandemic group, with the pandemic group somewhere in between. Additionally, both the pandemic and post-pandemic group showed higher levels of depression and acceptance/resignation coping styles than the pre-pandemic group. Thus, among the three groups of students, the post-pandemic group was the one that showed a larger effect of the pandemic situation in their psychological variables, presenting higher levels of anxiety (state and trait), depression, acceptation/resignation coping style, higher neuroticism (emotional instability trait), and lower agreeableness trait. Nonetheless, the increase of positive reappraisal in the post-pandemic group (an adaptive coping stress style) might be also a sign of recovery. The higher sleep bruxism for the pandemic group might be related to the pandemic situation and lockdown, passively suffered, possibly promoting feelings of impotency, increased levels of depression and acceptance/resignation (normally considered a passive/maladaptive coping style), while acute stressful situations derived from daily personal social interactions might have increased anxiety levels and induced higher levels of awake bruxism observed in both the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic groups. However, further research, including larger and more representative samples, is needed to confirm this possible relationship.\n",

      "nature-based interventions (NBI) have been shown to have positive effects on physical, psychological, social, and spiritual health. The purpose of this scoping literature review was to describe what is known regarding the cancer survivor experience in relationship to their interaction with the natural environment. Description/methods: this review was completed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The research strategy included a combination of these terms: cancer, neoplasms, nature, and forest therapy. The articles were blinded and screened by four independent researchers. A total of twelve articles were selected. Outcome/results: a total of 2786 cancer survivors participated in the twelve studies with multiple types and stages of cancer represented. The studies used multiple designs and measures. Results showed improvements in anxiety, depression, sleep, connectedness, stress, tension, confusion, fatigue, and pain. Participants reported that nature was the most important resource in coping with their cancer.\n",
      "nature is beneficial for cancer survivors while they experience cancer diagnosis and treatment. Nature opportunities can be feasibly delivered with this population and need to be explored further and safely implemented to support the overall health and well-being of cancer survivors.\n",

      "\"I Carry the Trauma and Can Vividly Remember\": Mental Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Frontline Health Care Workers in South Africa.\n",
      "We know from research that pandemics and disease outbreaks expose HCWs to an increased risk of short and long-term psychosocial and occupational impacts. We conducted qualitative research among 44 frontline health care workers (FHCWs) practicing in seven South African hospitals and clinics. FHCWs were interviewed on their experiences of working during the first-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and its perceived impact on their wellness. In this study, FHCWs included the non-medical and medical professionals in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, providing health care and treatment services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the FHCWs reported stressful and traumatic experiences relating to being exposed to a deadly virus and working in an emotionally taxing environment. They reported depression, anxiety, traumatic stress symptoms, demoralization, sleep difficulties, poor functioning, increased irritability and fear of being infected or dying from COVID-19. The mental health impacts of COVID-19 on HCWs were also associated with increased poor physical wellbeing, including fatigue, burnout, headache, and chest-pains. FHCWs reported professional commitment and their faith as critical intrinsic motivators that fostered adaptive coping while working on the frontline during the first-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many alluded to gaps in workplace psychosocial support which they perceived as crucial for coping mentally. The findings point to a need to prioritize interventions to promote mental wellness among FHCWs to ensure the delivery of quality healthcare to patients during pandemics or deadly disease outbreaks.\n",

      "Previous studies have investigated the associations between academic stress and adolescents' psycho-social development. However, the direct and indirect affecting mechanism of academic stress on sleep quality among Chinese adolescents have rarely been investigated. Using a self-report questionnaire data of 1232 adolescents in Jiangsu province, the purpose of the study is to investigate the relationships among academic stress, anxiety, school burnout, and sleep quality. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with Amos 25.0 was used to test the model fit in the present study. The results revealed that academic stress tends to have significantly direct effects on adolescents' sleep quality. Moreover, anxiety and school burnout could mediate the associations between academic stress and sleep quality absolutely and sequentially. This study reveals the mechanism of the effect of academic stress on adolescents' sleep quality and also develops the chain mediating model of anxiety and school burnout. In addition, the present study may shed light on social policy and social work intervention toward adolescents' sleep quality.\n",

      "Mental health in adolescence is a very important topic worldwide, especially in rural areas. The implementation of Participatory Action Research (PAR) through the photo-voice method was a way to encourage adults to recognize problematic situations (at personal, family or community levels) that threaten the well-being of adolescents, but that in everyday life may go unnoticed by parents and caregivers. Our study aimed to identify risk factors for mental health in adolescents living in rural communities of Ecuador from the parental perspective through photographs and focus group discussions. The study sought to raise awareness of this issue at the family and community levels. The photo-voice method was conducted with the participation of 29 parents. The photographs and the collaborative construction of meanings allowed parents to have a better understanding about the importance of mental health and its benefit for adolescents. The principal risk factors mentioned by parents were stress, sleep deprivation, tiredness, poverty, difficulties in continuing education and alcohol consumption. In conclusion, we point out the importance of this intervention to explore the knowledge and understanding of the topic by parents as well as to communicate information that demystifies false beliefs around mental health.\n",

In total, 1,684 undergraduate and graduate students (50.6% female, mean age 22.87 ± 3.15 years) from multiple academic disciplines completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing socio-demographic, health, and study-related indicators and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). In our sample, 820 (48.7%) met the PSQI cut-off score (>5) for poor sleep quality. Multiple regression analysis showed that older age, being a business student, lower subjective social status, poorer self-rated health, stress, exhaustion, and poor academic performance significantly predicted poor sleep quality. Our findings document a high prevalence of poor sleep quality among university students and suggest that business students, especially, might be exposed to a greater risk for poor sleep quality. Furthermore, the results of this study are valuable for academic staff to develop tailored interventions to promote healthy sleep-in university students.\n",

      "A total of 1306 individuals completed the survey. Of the participants, 77.79% were female at a mean age of 34.89 ± (14.79), 62.25% had higher education, and 56.43% were employed. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disturbances in this sample were as follows: 50.38%, 43.49%, 61.26%, and 44.74%, respectively. Poor self-estimated health status, the presence of comorbidities, and regular use of nicotine significantly increased the risk of any of the analyzed psychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders. The depression level was significantly associated with age, living alone, health status, and the use of nicotine. Moreover, the level of anxiety was significantly associated with age and health status. The level of stress depended on gender, age, health status, use of nicotine, and being vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Sleep disturbances depended on age, health status, the presence of comorbidities, and regular use of drugs.\n",

      "Mental health deterioration in young adults in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic is being increasingly studied. It is clear that the psychological consequences of the pandemic will be evident for many years, especially among the younger generation, who did not have time to acquire adaptive coping strategies before the outbreak of COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to assess the condition of the mental health of students at Polish universities after two years of the pandemic. The types of coping strategies used by the respondents to deal with stress were also evaluated in order to establish which of them could have a beneficial effect on the psyche of young people.\n",
      "This study included 721 participants (age [years]: M = 25.7, SD = 5.3; 269 (37.2%) males) recruited using snowball sampling from students at two universities in Lodz, Poland, and full-time doctoral students from across Poland (phase I of the study was conducted in March 2019 (\n",

The overall mental health of students at Polish universities, as measured by GHQ-28, was significantly worse in the group evaluated after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly in respect of anxiety symptoms and sleep disorders. 3. Female gender and professional inactivity appeared to be risk factors for the students' worsening mental health, which may be an indication of the need for further research and planning of psychotherapeutic interventions.\n",

      "Preventing Stress among High School Students in Denmark through the Multicomponent Healthy High School Intervention-The Effectiveness at First Follow-Up.\n",
      "Stress is a widespread phenomenon and young people especially are experiencing high levels of stress. School-related factors are the most frequently self-reported stressors among adolescents, but few interventions have targeted the school environment. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Healthy High School (HHS) intervention on stress at a 9-month follow-up. The study included 5201 first-year high school students (~16 years) in Denmark. Participating schools were randomized into the HHS intervention (N = 15) or control group (N = 15). Baseline measurements were conducted in August 2016 and the follow-up was conducted in May 2017. The intervention was designed to promote well-being (primary outcome) by focusing on physical activity, meals, sleep, sense of security, and stress (secondary outcomes). The intervention comprised: structural initiatives at the school level; a teaching material; peer-led innovation workshops; and a smartphone app. The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale was used to measure stress. Intervention effects on perceived stress were estimated using an intention-to-treat approach with multiple imputations of missing data and multilevel general linear regression modelling. A total of 4577 students answered the baseline questionnaire. No statistically significant difference was found in stress between students at intervention and control schools at the follow-up (mean score: 16.7 versus 16.7, adjusted b = 0.42, 95% CI: -0.16;1.00). The HHS Study is one of the first large randomized controlled trials targeting school environmental stressors. Potential implementation failures and the failures of the program theory are discussed.\n",

      "Cognitive Behavior Therapy by Nurses in Reducing Symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder on Children as Victims of Violence: A Scoping Review.\n",
      "Violence against children can cause psychological problems such as post-traumatic syndrome disorder (PTSD). The negative impact of violence on children is psychological and physical problems and risk of suicide. Nurses have a role to provide comprehensive nursing care such as cognitive behavior therapy for reducing PTSD symptoms. The purpose of this study was to describe the methods of cognitive behavior therapy to reduce symptoms of PTSD in children who are victims of violence. This study used the scoping review method. The databases use for the literature review in this study were CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus. The keywords used in English were \"cognitive behavioral therapy OR CBT\" AND \"violence OR abuse\" AND \"post-traumatic stress disorder OR PTSD\" AND \"child OR children\". The inclusion criteria were full text, randomized control trial or quasi-experimental research design, English language, the sample was children, and the publication period was for the last 10 years (2013-2022). We found 10 articles discussing CBT intervention on children who experienced victim abuse to reduce symptoms of PTSD. Most of the articles in this study used randomized control trial design. Several samples in this study are from the USA. The total sample was 47-320 respondents. This study showed three methods of CBT, namely psychoeducation, self-management, and coping strategies. CBT interventions can be carried out face-to-face or online. The activities carried out by the participants were relaxing, participating in training, counseling, problem-solving discussions, and therapy to improve sleep quality. Cognitive behavioral therapy is an intervention that can be carried out to reduce the traumatic impact on child victims of violence by taking into account the characteristics and development of the children.\n",

      "Suicidal behaviors in adolescents stem from complex processes deeply rooted in various spheres of life and functioning. The study was aimed at assessing the relationship between selected negative emotions, the quality of sleep, the level of perceived stress as well as stress coping strategies and suicidal ideation and attempts among high school students. The examined group consisted of adolescents aged 16-18 recruited by social-media groups in Poland. The study was based on a diagnostic survey with the application of CAWI method. The other research tools applied in the study included: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Modified, Perceived Stress Scale-10, How do you cope?-Questionnaire, Athens Insomnia Scale as well as the authors' own questionnaire on suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Anxiety, depression, aggression and insomnia as well as a high level of stress were statistically more common in girls than in boys (\n",

      "Emotional Arousal Impacts Physical Health in Dogs: A Review of Factors Influencing Arousal, with Exemplary Case and Framework.\n",
      "Excessive emotional arousal has been shown to impact physiological health in both veterinary species and human animals. The focus of work in many models of veterinary behavioural medicine has predominantly been associated with reducing activation of the protective emotional systems; in particular, fear-anxiety. The management of the engaging emotional systems of desire-seeking, social play, care and lust has not traditionally been considered in the treatment of physiological health of veterinary species. This article reviews the literature in both veterinary and human fields on the relationship between emotional arousal of both protective and engaging emotional systems and physical health conditions. The current literature describing the regulatory control of sleep on emotional arousal is also discussed. An exemplary case report of a seven month old male entire Cocker Spaniel showing fly-snapping behaviour which had been non-responsive to leviteracetam (Keppra) is presented. The emotional health assessment and treatment of this case is described along with the short and long term (fourteen month follow up) outcomes to demonstrate that some patients presenting in this way can be effectively managed with an appropriate behavioural medicine treatment plan. The authors put forward the argument that an emotional health assessment should be considered an essential component of the work up of all such cases.\n",

      "The sound of stress recovery: an exploratory study of self-selected music listening after stress.\n",
      "Empirical support for the notion that music listening is beneficial for stress recovery is inconclusive, potentially due to the methodological diversity with which the effects of music on stress recovery have been investigated. Little is presently known about which recovery activities are chosen by individuals for the purpose of stress recovery, and whether audio feature commonalities exist between different songs that are selected by individuals for the purpose of stress recovery. The current pre-registered study investigated whether audio feature commonalities can be extracted from self-selected songs for the purpose of stress recovery. Furthermore, the present study exploratorily examined the relationship between audio features and participants' desired recovery-related emotions while listening and after listening to self-selected music.\n",
      "Participants (N = 470) completed an online survey in which they described what music they would listen to unwind from a hypothetical stressful event. Data analysis was conducted using a split-sample procedure. A k-medoid cluster analysis was conducted to identify audio feature commonalities between self-selected songs. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between audio features and desired recovery emotions.\n",
      "Participants valued music listening as a recovery activity to a similar extent as watching TV, sleeping, or talking to a significant other. Cluster analyses revealed that self-selected songs for the purpose of stress recovery can be grouped into two distinct categories. The two categories of songs shared similarities in key, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, musical valence, tempo, duration, and time signature, and were distinguished by danceability, energy, and mode. No audio features were significantly associated with participants' desired recovery emotions.\n",
      "Although a comprehensive portrait of the relationship between audio features and stress recovery still warrants further research, the present study provides a starting point for future enquiries into the nuanced effects of musical audio features on stress recovery.\n",

      "Cancer patients with financial toxicity experience psychological distress and often miss medical appointments and quit treatments early, which could be a barrier to the effective management of oral chemotherapy drugs at home. This study explores whether financial toxicity predicts symptoms and unplanned healthcare utilization among cancer patients taking oral chemotherapy at home, which will contribute to the safe management of oral chemotherapy.\n",
      "Data in this study was from a prospective observational study, which was conducted between October 2018 and December 2019. 151 patients completed the Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity at discharge and completed the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory and unplanned healthcare utilization questionnaires after finishing one cycle of oral chemotherapy at home. Regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations of financial toxicity with symptoms and unplanned healthcare utilization.\n",
      "Among 151participants, 88.08% reported severe or moderate financial toxicity, 43.05% reported symptom interference, and 31.79% reported unplanned healthcare utilization while taking oral chemotherapy at home. Patients between the age of 45-60y (p = 0.042) have higher financial toxicity, while those living in urban areas (p = 0.016) have lower financial toxicity. Patients with worse financial toxicity suffered increased symptoms of fatigue, emotional distress, disturbed sleep, and lack of appetite. Consequently, their mood and personal relation with other significant suffered. However, no statistical differences in unplanned healthcare utilization were found among patients with different levels of financial toxicity.\n",
      "Middle-aged adults and those living in suburban or rural areas experienced worse financial toxicity than other groups. Patients with worse financial toxicity experienced more severe psychological symptoms (e.g., fatigue, distress, disturbed sleep, and lack of appetite) and affective interference (e.g., mood and relations with others). Identifying at-risk patients is necessary to offer tailored support for psychological symptom management.\n",

      "There were no significant differences in reported history of stress fracture (15% vs 9%; P=0.70) or sleep quality scores (4.4 vs 5.5; P=0.15) between the ultramarathon and half marathon/10-km groups. Over half of both groups reported trying to change body weight to improve performance, without significant differences between groups (65% vs 53%; P=0.42). A significantly greater proportion of the ultramarathoners reported an episode of binge eating in the 4 wk preceding the race (38% vs 3%; P=0.001).\n",

      "The Cutting Edge of Epigenetic Clocks: In Search of Mechanisms Linking Aging and Mental Health.\n",
      "Individuals with psychiatric disorders are at increased risk of age-related diseases and early mortality. Recent studies demonstrate that this link between mental health and aging is reflected in epigenetic clocks, aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation. The reported relationships between epigenetic clocks and mental health are mostly correlational, and the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we review recent progress concerning the molecular and cellular processes underlying epigenetic clocks, as well as novel technologies enabling further studies of the causes and consequences of epigenetic aging. We then review the current literature on how epigenetic clocks relate to specific aspects of mental health, such as stress, medications, substance use, health behaviors, and symptom clusters. We propose an integrated framework where mental health and epigenetic aging are each broken down into multiple distinct processes which are then linked to each other, using stress and schizophrenia as examples. This framework incorporates the heterogeneity and complexity of both mental health conditions and aging, may help reconcile conflicting results, and provides a basis for further hypothesis-driven research in humans and model systems to investigate potentially causal mechanisms linking aging and mental health.\n",

      "Long-term exposure to traffic noise and risk of incident colon cancer: A pooled study of eleven Nordic cohorts.\n",
      "Background Colon cancer incidence is rising globally, and factors pertaining to urbanization have been proposed involved in this development. Traffic noise may increase colon cancer risk by causing sleep disturbance and stress, thereby inducing known colon cancer risk-factors, e.g. obesity, diabetes, physical inactivity, and alcohol consumption, but few studies have examined this. Objectives The objective of this study was to investigate the association between traffic noise and colon cancer (all, proximal, distal) in a pooled population of 11 Nordic cohorts, totaling 155,203 persons. Methods We identified residential address history and estimated road, railway, and aircraft noise, as well as air pollution, for all addresses, using similar exposure models across cohorts. Colon cancer cases were identified through national registries. We analyzed data using Cox Proportional Hazards Models, adjusting main models for harmonized sociodemographic and lifestyle data. Results During follow-up (median 18.8 years), 2757 colon cancer cases developed. We found a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99-1.10) per 10-dB higher 5-year mean time-weighted road traffic noise. In sub-type analyses, the association seemed confined to distal colon cancer: HR 1.06 (95% CI: 0.98-1.14). Railway and aircraft noise was not associated with colon cancer, albeit there was some indication in sub-type analyses that railway noise may also be associated with distal colon cancer. In interaction-analyses, the association between road traffic noise and colon cancer was strongest among obese persons and those with high NO\n",

      "An ecological approach to clinically assess nightmares in military service members with severe PTSD.\n",
      "Trauma-related nightmares (TRNs) are distressing events which contribute to insomnia severity, chronicity and treatment resistance of PTSD. Therefore, recording TRNs is a crucial technical challenge in order to understand their physiopathological patterns and their impact on sleep. However, TRNs are difficult to record during a single night in a sleep laboratory, which, moreover, is likely to be considered by patients as a protective sleep environment that is therefore not representative of home sleep conditions.\n",
      "In the present study, we investigate if objective sleep measures acquired at-home using two ambulatory devices is of clinical value by correlating with PTSD patients' complaints about sleep and nightmares. A secondary objective is to relate awakenings associated with TRNs to sleep stages and to provide new insights into the use of electrodermal activity (EDA) as a potential physiological marker of TRNs. Sixty veterans and active-duty service members were assessed by questionnaires and recorded for 5 consecutive nights in their homes.\n",
      "Our approach firstly identified positive correlations between subjective and objective sleep parameters (total sleep time, sleep-onset latency and TRNs frequency). We also developed a method of synchronization between the two ambulatory devices that allowed us to match 200 TRNs (reported by event marker push button) with sleep stages corresponding to 91 nights and 37 patients. Most awakenings associated with TRNs occurred during NREM sleep (65.5% versus 34.5% during REM sleep). Our results also reveal significant differences in the frequency of EDA peaks 10 min before the reported events, with a lower frequency in REM (13.7 peaks) than in NREM (24.8 peaks) awakenings associated with TRNs. This EDA peaks frequency in REM sleep is not statistically different from that in REM sleep preceding awakenings that are not associated with TRNs.\n",

This study aimed to assess sleep patterns and their connections with psychological outcomes in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and cancer and their caregivers, compared to a control sample. In addition, we explored the associations between caregiver and child's sleep quality across the three groups.\n",
      "We enrolled 56 children with T1D, 33 children with cancer, and 61 healthy children between 7 and 15, and their respective caregivers. Caregivers filled out an ad-hoc survey assessing their sleep disturbances, parenting stress, general well-being, anxiety, and their children's sleep patterns and psychological adjustments.\n",
      "Children with cancer showed lower sleep quality than the other groups. Moreover, worse psychological adjustment was associated with greater sleep disturbances in both clinical groups. As for caregivers, the cancer group reported the worst sleep quality and greater anxiety compared to the other samples. Greater anxiety was also linked to worse sleep quality. Furthermore, greater sleep problems in children were associated with poorer caregivers' sleep quality in the whole sample and the T1D group.\n",
      "A better understanding of sleep patterns and problems for chronically ill children and their parents is fundamental to provide adequate care for these vulnerable populations. Furthermore, an illness-specific approach may better inform and guide the practitioners in clinical practice.\n",

      "Managing a skin condition can be difficult, and there is a lack of psychological support for children and their families.\n",
      "The objectives of this study were to identify issues surrounding caring for a child with a skin condition, investigate experiences of current psychological support to gain a sense of what is needed, and determine the relevance of offering mindfulness-based interventions for children and families.\n",
      "This study employed a mixed inductive and deductive form of qualitative inquiry to understand children and families experiences and needs.\n",
      "Twenty-three participants (n = 12 parents/carers, n = 11 female, n = 1 male), (n = 11 children, n = 6 female, n = 5 male, aged 8-11 years) were recruited with an advert posted on social media. In-depth data was collected from semi-structured interviews. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed with a descriptive form of thematic analysis.\n",
      "Systematic analysis of the data led to five themes being developed: (1) Caregiver burden of childhood skin conditions; (2) Skin condition overshadowing childhood; (3) Battling for recognition and lack of support; (4) Naturalistic use and understanding of mindfulness in everyday coping: and (5) Openness and relevance of offering a mindfulness-based interventions.\n",
      "Living with a skin condition was reported as being associated with mood disturbance, with impacts on schooling, sleep, and daily life. Parents and children expressed a desire for short/accessible interventions that could fit with daily routines and might provide the opportunity to connect with other families. The findings indicate that mindfulness-based interventions may be likely to be accepted, as many participants had experience of using mindful techniques in school, and described that they were naturalistically using 'mindfulness' to manage itch and stress. However, the findings indicate that a number of misconceptions exist about the fundamental nature and aims of mindfulness.

      "Despite the great individual and societal burden associated with multimorbidity, little is known about how to effectively manage it.\n",
      "The aim of this multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the 12-month effects of a personalized exercise therapy and self-management support program in addition to usual care in people with multimorbidity.\n",
      "This is a protocol for a pragmatic, parallel-group (1:1 ratio), superiority RCT conducted at five intervention sites (two hospitals, a private practice physiotherapy clinic and two municipal rehabilitation centers) in Region Zealand, Denmark. A total of 228 persons with multimorbidity aged 18 years or older, will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. Both groups will receive usual care, defined as routine care for multimorbidity at the discretion of the treating doctor, while the intervention group will also participate in a 12-week exercise therapy and self-management support program tailored to people with multimorbidity at one of the intervention sites. The primary outcome will be the between-group difference in change in EQ-5D-5L from baseline to the follow-up at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include objectively-measured physical function and physical activity, inflammatory markers, disease and treatment burden, anxiety, depression, stress, sleep, pain and other self-reported parameters. In parallel with the RCT, an observational cohort will follow persons aged ≥18 years with multimorbidity not adhering to all eligibility criteria, as well as people fulfilling all eligibility criteria, but unwilling to participate in the RCT. This study was approved by the Regional Committee on Health Research Ethics for Region Zealand (SJ-857) and results will be communicated in scientific papers, at relevant conferences and to a broader audience.\n",
      "Exercise therapy and self-management support is safe and effective in people with single conditions. However, it is still unclear whether this holds true for individuals with multimorbidity. This pragmatic, multicenter RCT will provide high-quality evidence on the benefits and harms of exercise therapy and self-management support and, if the results support it, lead to the development of a plan for implementation in clinical practice.\n",

A variety of non-pharmacological approaches including lifestyle medicine (e.g., exercise, nutrition, sleep) and positive psychology practices (e.g., gratitude, service), are effective for treating mental health (MH) conditions.\n",
      "Twenty-six individuals from South Africa with a diagnosed MH condition participated in a 10-week multimodal intervention incorporating a diverse range of non-pharmacological strategies for improving MH. MH metrics were assessed pre-and post-intervention, including general MH, vitality/energy (VIT), depression, anxiety, stress, and satisfaction with life. MH and VIT were also measured weekly.\n",

      "Effect of Acupoint Therapies on Postoperative Sleep Quality: A Narrative Review.\n",
      "Several studies have reported that sleep quality often decreases in patients after surgery, especially in elderly patients, which seriously affects postoperative prognosis and outcomes, inducing diseases such as postoperative delirium, long-term chronic pain, and potentially fatal cardiovascular events. With the popularization of comfortable medicine, medical workers pay more attention to the postoperative sleep quality of patients. The causes underlying the decrease in postoperative sleep quality may include postoperative pain, the severity of surgical trauma and stress, perioperative anxiety and depression, and postoperative complications. Patients with insomnia often use acupoint therapies as a safe and effective alternative to drugs. Acupoint therapies are among the oldest medical therapies of Traditional Chinese Medicine and are gradually gaining recognition among medical workers worldwide. Various types of acupoint stimulation methods such as transcutaneous electrical acupoint simulation (TEAS), acupressure, acupuncture, and electroacupuncture can change the brain's local electrical activity, inhibit the central nervous system, and achieve deep sedation through stimulating the related acupoints, which provides a novel idea and basis for improvement in factors affecting postoperative sleep quality. This review explores the mechanism of acupoint therapies from several aspects of affecting the sleep quality of patients after surgery and its clinical results. We found that acupoint therapies effectively improve sleep quality and alleviate the postoperative complications of patients, and we emphasize the importance of acupoint therapies to guide future research and clinical practice. Large-scale, multicenter studies are needed to determine the optimal duration, frequency, and timing of acupoint stimulation for improving postoperative sleep quality.\n",

      "Stress and its impairment of skin barrier function.\n",
      "The principal function of skin is to provide a barrier to water loss and percutaneous penetration of exogenous substances. Any compromise of the skin homeostasis can lead to dryness, itchiness, or even pathogenic conditions. This study aimed to explore the relationship among psychological stress, skin homeostasis, sleep quality, and emotion.\n",
      "This prospective observational study was conducted using a random sample of medical students from Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University. A questionnaire including the validated Chinese version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI) was distributed. The skin barrier function was measured by the transepidermal water loss (TEWL), hydration of skin. Dermoscopic images of the nose and infraorbital skin were obtained. We compared the skin homeostasis, sleep quality, and emotional state of medical students at different time points of the semester and explored the correlation between the variables.\n",
      "As the semester progressed, the sleep quality and severity of anxiety of medical students got significantly worse, and they were closely related to the impaired skin barrier function. Both irregular schedule and stress can aggravate dark circles.\n",
      "Mental stress can do harm to skin barrier through poor sleep and severe anxiety. The amount of sebum was positively correlated with the severity of anxiety while blackheads are mainly influenced by season change. Dermoscopy has a unique role in assessing blackheads and dark circles.\n",

      "Dyslipidemia is one of the known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. At present, the study of dyslipidemia has gradually shifted from simple environmental or genetic factors to environment-gene interactions. In order to further explore the etiology and mechanism of dyslipidemia, we used occupational stress(OS) and LYPLAL1, APOC3 and SOD2 gene as research variables to explore their association with dyslipidemia.Here we used a case-control study to include Han workers from a coal mining enterprise in China to determine the association between study variables and dyslipidemia. Monofactor analysis showed that smoking, drinking, physical activity level, DASH diet score, sleep quality, BMI, hypertension, hyperuricemia, shift work, OS were significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.05). In the APOC3 rs2854116 dominant model, patients with CT/CC genotype had a higher risk of dyslipidemia than those with TT genotype. In SOD2 rs4880 recessive model, patients with GG genotype had a lower risk of dyslipidemia than those with AA/AG genotype, and the difference was statistically significant. We found that rs12137855 and OS, rs2854116 and OS, rs4880 and OS had joint effects, but no interaction based on the multiplication and addition model was found (P\n",

      "Chronic corticosterone deteriorates latrine and nesting behaviours in mice.\n",
      "Self-care behaviours are actions that help maintain good health and surroundings. For example, appropriate toileting, sleeping in the bed, and bathing and washing are among self-care behaviours in humans. Animals also perform similar self-care behaviours such as latrine, nesting and self-grooming. Studies have shown that chronic stress disrupts nesting and self-grooming behaviours. However, the effect of chronic stress on latrine behaviour, preferential, repeated defecation at specific locations, has not yet been clarified. This study aimed to investigate the influence of chronic corticosterone administration on latrine and nesting behaviours in mice. The variation in defecation location was quantified as the degree of the latrine behaviour by using Shannon entropy. The nest quality was scored based on shape. The study showed that mice exposed to chronic corticosterone had scattered defecation sites and lower nest quality compared to the control group. Furthermore, results showed that more scattered defecation behaviour was associated with lower nest quality at an individual level. Additionally, the deterioration of these self-care behaviours was associated with depression-like behaviours such as less open field activity and increased immobility time during the tail suspension test. These results suggest that chronic corticosterone deteriorates self-care behaviours such as latrine and nesting in mice.\n",

      "In the context of increased media use and family distress during the pandemic, we examine whether preschooler screen time at age 3.5 contributes to later expressions of anger/frustration at 4.5, while also considering the inverse association.\n",
      "Data are from a cohort of 315 Canadian preschool-aged children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parent-reported measures included child h/day of screen time and child temperamental anger/frustration, both measured at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age. Indicators of family distress include use of childcare and child sleep, family income, parenting stress, and parent education, marital and employment status. We also consider child sex as a control variable.\n",
      "A crossed-lagged panel model revealed continuity in screen time between the ages of 3.5 and 4.5 (ß = 0.68) and temperamental anger/frustration from 3.5 to 4.5 (ß = 0.60). Child screen time at age 3.5 predicted increased proneness to anger/frustration at age 4.5 (ß = 0.14). Anger/frustration at age 3.5 did not predict screen time at age 4.5.\n",
      "Our results suggest that preschooler screen time during the pandemic may have undermined the ability to regulate negative emotions, a key component of social and academic competence. Supporting parents in implementing healthy media habits post pandemic may benefit young children's development.\n",
      "Key message: this study observes prospective bidirectional associations between preschoolers screen time and temperamental displays of anger or frustration during the COVID-19 pandemic. What does it add: we provide evidence that preschool screen time at age 3.5 prospectively contributes to the tendency to react in anger/frustration at age 4.5. In contrast, greater proneness to anger/frustration did not predict later exposure to screen time. What is the impact: health practitioners should enquire about media use habits during well-child visits to foster children's healthy development during the preschool years.\n",

      "Association Between Variations in Training Load, Sleep, and the Well-Being of Professional Hockey Players.\n",
      "To evaluate whether sleep quantity and quality of professional hockey players is affected by external training load (TL), their perception of well-being, and contextual factors associated with match participation.\n",
      "Fifty male athletes were monitored daily during the 28 weeks of the regular season using well-being and sleep surveys. On-ice external TL was monitored using portable inertial measurement units during practices and matches. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to evaluate whether well-being perception (ie, pain, nutrition, stress, and rest) and external TL may affect sleep quality and quantity.\n",
      "High levels of well-being positively affected sleep duration and quality (P < .001), whereas high-intensity TL had a detrimental impact on sleep duration (P = .007). Moreover, away and evening matches had a detrimental effect on sleep quantity and quality (P < .001). Finally, a high match on-ice load per minute had a negative association with sleep quality (P = .04).\n",
      "Findings indicate that well-being and high-intensity trainings can impair sleep duration and quality. In addition, high-intensity match load, away matches, and evening matches can impair postmatch sleep. Therefore, monitoring well-being in conjunction with TL is essential to understand sleep disturbances in athletes. Practitioners should also implement sleep hygiene strategies that facilitate longer time in bed after high-intensity, away, and evening matches to help athletes recover.\n",

      "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a behavioral intervention on sleep problems, which are significant and an unmet clinical need in children with Angelman Syndrome (AS).\n",
      "Children (2-18 years) with AS and sleep problems were randomized to a behavioral intervention program or a control group. Intervention consisted of a standardized program including home visits, psycho-education, feedback based on direct observation of bedtime routine and video footage of the night and behavioral treatment techniques by a behavioral therapist. Change in sleep duration (primary) and parental sleep, nighttime visits, sleep hygiene, daytime behavior, parental stress and quality of life (secondary) were assessed post-intervention and at follow-up using questionnaires, diary, actigraphy and videosomnography.\n",
      "The groups, 9 children in each, did not differ at baseline. We found a significant effect of intervention on wake after sleep onset with classical statistical analysis (videosomnography). With single case analysis we found a positive effect on total sleep time (diary and actigraphy) and wake after sleep onset (diary) with a persistent effect on total sleep time (actigraphy) and wake after sleep onset (diary). On secondary outcome there was a significant and persistent effect on sleep hygiene and several quality of life domains.\n",
      "Behavioral intervention has a positive and persistent effect on sleep problems in children with AS. We advise psycho-education for all parents and use of videosomnography for both evaluation of and feedback on sleep behavior patterns, individual behavioral advice and specific behavioral techniques for children with sleep problems.\n",

      "Contribution of risk and resilience factors to anxiety trajectories during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study.\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic, and the response of governments to mitigate the pandemic's spread, resulted in exceptional circumstances that comprised a major global stressor, with broad implications for mental health. We aimed to delineate anxiety trajectories over three time-points in the first 6 months of the pandemic and identify baseline risk and resilience factors that predicted anxiety trajectories. Within weeks of the pandemic onset, we established a website (covid19resilience.org), and enrolled 1362 participants (n = 1064 from US; n = 222 from Israel) who provided longitudinal data between April-September 2020. We used latent growth mixture modelling to identify anxiety trajectories and ran multivariate regression models to compare characteristics between trajectory classes. A four-class model best fit the data, including a resilient trajectory (stable low anxiety) the most common (n = 961, 75.08%), and chronic anxiety (n = 149, 11.64%), recovery (n = 96, 7.50%) and delayed anxiety (n = 74, 5.78%) trajectories. Resilient participants were older, not living alone, with higher income, more education, and reported fewer COVID-19 worries and better sleep quality. Higher resilience factors' scores, specifically greater emotion regulation and lower conflict relationships, also uniquely distinguished the resilient trajectory. Results are consistent with the pre-pandemic resilience literature suggesting that most individuals show stable mental health in the face of stressful events. Findings can inform preventative interventions for improved mental health.\n",

      "Animal models of human insomnia.\n",
      "Insomnia disorder (chronic sleep continuity disturbance) is a debilitating condition affecting 5%-10% of the adult population worldwide. To date, researchers have attempted to model insomnia in animals through breeding strategies that create pathologically short-sleeping individuals or with drugs and environmental contexts that directly impose sleeplessness. While these approaches have been invaluable for identifying insomnia susceptibility genes and mapping the neural networks that underpin sleep-wake regulation, they fail to capture concurrently several of the core clinical diagnostic features of insomnia disorder in humans, where sleep continuity disturbance is self-perpetuating, occurs despite adequate sleep opportunity, and is often not accompanied by significant changes in sleep duration or architecture. In the present review, we discuss these issues and then outline ways animal models can be used to develop approaches that are more ecologically valid in their recapitulation of chronic insomnia's natural aetiology and pathophysiology. Conditioning of self-generated sleep loss with these methods promises to create a better understanding of the neuroadaptations that maintain insomnia, including potentially within the infralimbic cortex, a substrate at the crossroads of threat habituation and sleep.\n",

      "Stress and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis: How can the COVID-19 pandemic inform our understanding and treatment of acute insomnia?\n",
      "Stress and sleep are very closely linked, and stressful life events can trigger acute insomnia. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is highly likely to represent one such stressful life event. Indeed, a wide range of cross-sectional studies demonstrate that the pandemic is associated with poor sleep and sleep disturbances. Given the high economic and health burden of insomnia disorder, strategies that can prevent and treat acute insomnia, and also prevent the transition from acute insomnia to insomnia disorder, are necessary. This narrative review outlines why the COVID-19 pandemic is a stressful life event, and why activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as a biological marker of psychological stress, is likely to result in acute insomnia. Further, this review outlines how sleep disturbances might arise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and why simultaneous hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis measurement can inform the pathogenesis of acute insomnia. In particular, we focus on the cortisol awakening response as a marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, as cortisol is the end-product of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. From a research perspective, future opportunities include identifying individuals, or particular occupational or societal groups (e.g. frontline health staff), who are at high risk of developing acute insomnia, and intervening. From an acute insomnia treatment perspective, priorities include testing large-scale online behavioural interventions; examining if reducing the impact of stress is effective and, finally, assessing whether \"sleep vaccination\" can maintain good sleep health by preventing the occurrence of acute insomnia, by preventing the transition from acute insomnia to insomnia disorder.\n",

      "The chronic sleep deprivation model was established involving C57BL/6mice; the body weight, behavioral characteristics, hippocampal structure, oxidative stress, apoptosis-related protein expression, and intestinal bacteria in mice were assessed to characterise hydrolyzed seawater pearl tablet.\n",
      "Hydrolyzed seawater pearl tablet significantly accelerated body weight, open field test score, and sugar water preference rate (P< 0.05), alleviated the structural damage of hippocampus, reduced the content of MDA (P< 0.05), Bax protein expression, increased the content of GSH (P< 0.05), the activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and Bcl-2 protein expression in the hippocampus, increased the amount of beneficial bacteria (P< 0.05), and reduced the amount of harmful bacteria in the intestine of chronic sleep deprivation mice (P< 0.05).\n",
      "Hydrolyzed seawater pearl tablet can improve the depression-like mental state of mice caused by chronic sleep deprivation. The mechanism involves improving the antioxidant activity of the hippocampus to eliminate the excessive ROS, which inhibits cell apoptosis and alleviates tissue structure damage. Meanwhile, it may also be involved in adjusting the microbiota level and improving the mental and behavioral activities of chronic sleep deprivation mice through the intestine-brain axis.\n",

      "Investigating mental defeat in individuals with chronic pain: Protocol for a longitudinal experience sampling study.\n",
      "Previous qualitative and cross-sectional research has identified a strong sense of mental defeat in people with chronic pain who also experience the greatest levels of distress and disability. This study will adopt a longitudinal experience sampling design to examine the within-person link between the sense of mental defeat and distress and disability associated with chronic pain.\n",
      "We aim to recruit 198 participants (aged 18-65 years) with chronic pain, to complete two waves of experience sampling over 1 week, 6 months apart (time 1 and time 2). During each wave of experience sampling, the participants are asked to complete three short online surveys per day, to provide in-the-moment ratings of mental defeat, pain, medication usage, physical and social activity, stress, mood, self-compassion, and attention using visual analogue scales. Sleep and physical activity will be measured using a daily diary as well as with wrist actigraphy worn continuously by participants throughout each wave. Linear mixed models and Gaussian graphical models will be fit to the data to: (1) examine the within-person, day-to-day association of mental defeat with outcomes (ie, pain, physical/social activity, medication use and sleep), (2) examine the dynamic temporal and contemporaneous networks of mental defeat with all outcomes and the hypothesised mechanisms of outcomes (ie, perceived stress, mood, attention and self-compassion).\n",
      "The current protocol has been approved by the Health Research Authority and West Midlands-Solihull Research Ethics Committee (Reference Number: 17/WM0053). The study is being conducted in adherence with the Declaration of Helsinki, Warwick Standard Operating Procedures and applicable UK legislation.\n",

      "Prevalence, characteristics, and health burden of rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. veteran population.\n",
      "To examine the prevalence, characteristics, and physical and mental health burden of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a nationally representative sample of U.S. military veterans.\n",
      "Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS), which surveyed a contemporary, nationally representative sample of 4,069 U.S. veterans. Veterans with RA (n = 227) were compared to veterans with any other medical condition(s) (n = 3,444) on measures of sociodemographic, military, trauma, medical and psychiatric characteristics. Multivariable analyses were then conducted to examine independent associations between RA and health conditions.\n",
      "A total of 5.3% (95% confidence interval = 4.5-6.2%) of primarily male U.S. veterans reported having been diagnosed with RA. Relative to controls, veterans with RA were older, and more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities, unpartnered, lower income, and combat veterans. They also reported greater cumulative trauma burden, more medical conditions (i.e., osteoarthritis, chronic pain, respiratory and cardiovascular conditions), and greater severity of somatic symptoms, and were more likely to screen positive for current insomnia and subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and lifetime alcohol use disorder (AUD). In adjusted analyses, RA remained associated with number of medical conditions, more severe somatic symptoms, insomnia, subthreshold PTSD, and AUD.\n",
      "One of 20 U.S. veterans has RA, which is more prevalent among certain sociodemographic subsets, and is associated with elevated physical and mental health burden. Results provide insight into risk correlates of RA and underscore the importance of assessing, monitoring, and treating medical and psychiatric conditions/symptoms that co-occur with RA in this population.\n",

      "Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine Position Paper on Patient Sleep During Hospitalization.\n",
      "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.\n",

      "The study's self-administered survey included demographics and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Self-Control and Self-Management Scale (SCMS). Associations with PSS were determined using a multiple variable linear regression analysis.\n",
      "Scores for stress (28.45±7.82) and self-management (55.73±12.15) were moderate for employees. Of the 181 employees, 41.43% had a mild, 52.48% had moderate, and 6.07% had severe stress levels. Stress was significantly associated with lower self-management level. A negative relation was found between SCMS and PSS (p = 0.000, r = -0.320). Employees with high self-management skills had low stress levels. Employees also reported negative changes to physical activity, income and sleep. Gender, occupation, income category, compliance with COVID-related rules and self-management were associated with levels of stress (p < 0.05). The regression model explained 24.8% of the variance in stress perception (R2 = 0.248, F = 11.452, p = 0.000). Multiple linear regression analysis showed gender (β = 5.089, 95% CI: 2.820 to 7.358, p = 0.000) compliance with COVID-related rules (β = 2.274, CI: 0.066 to 4.483, p = 0.044), a decrease in income (β = 2.051, CI: -0.64 to 4.166, p = 0.057) and self-management (β = -0.173, CI: -0.258 to -0.087, p = 0.000) were significantly associated with lower scores in the stress perception.\n",

      "Sleep disturbance is an outcome of multiple factors including environmental and genetic influences. Job stress, a complex environmental factor, likely affects sleep quality, significantly reducing the quality of life of workers. Additionally, FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) may be a pathogenic factor for sleep disturbance as it regulates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, where HPA axis has been found to be involved in the regulation mechanism of sleep and stress response.\n",

      "This study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression in middle-aged and elderly patients with diabetes in China, determine the risk factors of depression in these patients, and explore the internal relationship between influencing factors and depression by constructing a pathway model.\n",
      "Data were collected from the 2018 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHRLS). We included 1743 patients with diabetes who were assessed using the CES-D10, which is used to measure depressive symptoms in Chinese older adults. Based on the theory of psychological stress, data were analyzed using SPSS software version 22.0 and MPLUS 8.0. A correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between the variables and depression scores. A path model was constructed to explore the interrelationships between variables and verify the relationships between variables and depression in patients with diabetes.\n",
      "The prevalence of depression among patients with diabetes was 42.5%. The path analysis results showed that income, diabetes duration, sleep duration, pain distress, self-rated health, and glycemic control directly affected depression, and self-rated health had the largest effect value. With self-rated health and glycemic control as mediator variables, income, diabetes duration, sleep duration, pain distress, glycemic control, and insulin use had indirect effects on depression by influencing self-rated health. Age, frequency of blood glucose monitoring, and exercise glycemic control awareness indirectly affected depression by affecting glycemic control, self-rated health status, and depression.\n",
      "We found that the path analysis model could construct the interaction between the influencing factors and explore the potential interrelationship between the influencing factors and diabetes-related depression. Patients with diabetes must adhere to regular medication, maintain a healthy lifestyle, and have effective glycemic control. Diabetes depression can be effectively prevented by making psychological knowledge publicly available, providing health education, and establishing corresponding for diabetes.\n",

      "Problematic Social Networking Site use-effects on mental health and the brain.\n",
      "The association between excessive use of Social Networking Sites (SNS) and mental health is raising serious concern among health and education professionals. Problematic SNS use has been associated with an increased rate of depression, anxiety, stress, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and propensity to excessive alcohol use. It may also lead to vulnerability to aggression, cyberbullying and fear of missing out (FOMO). There is little evidence for cognitive impairments, but there is some preliminary event-related potentials (ERPs) evidence for inefficiency in allocating and monitoring resources and inhibitory control. Problematic SNS has been associated with the personality traits of conscientiousness agreeableness and neuroticism, and with narcissism. There is evidence for reduced sleep quality and quantity, longer sleeping latency and more sleep disturbance. The few brain imaging studies show some similarity between problematic SNS use and other addictions related to inhibitory-control mechanism, reduced gray matter volumes in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and the insula, suggesting rewarding effects of SNS use on the brain. Finally, there is preliminary evidence that treatment with Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) can assist in short-term abstinence intervention to treat problematic SNS use. We conclude that problematic SNS use may have deleterious effects on emotional and social relationships, and more research is required on its effects on cognitive and brain function.\n",

      "Targeting the endocannabinoid system may have a role in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, few studies have examined the effectiveness of cannabis on symptoms of PTSD, and more research is needed to ascertain cannabis' effectiveness. In this retrospective naturalistic study, we followed 14 relatively mature (32-68 years of age), treatment-resistant, chronic combat post-traumatic patients who remained severely symptomatic despite treatment with many lines of conventional treatment prior to receiving medicinal cannabis. Our findings show that total sleep score, subjective sleep quality, and sleep duration significantly improved (\n",

      "The Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Police Officers' Stress Reduction: a Systematic Review.\n",
      "The profession of a police officer is associated with high levels of stress, which can have harmful consequences for officers' personal lives, the police organisation, and society. This systematic review aims to synthesise recent literature on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention related to stress reduction (MBIs) in a sample of police officers. The search of relevant articles was applied in four databases (SpringerLink, Web of Science, Academic Search Ultimate (EBSCO), and PubMed), using the following inclusion criteria: (1) study involved police officers; (2) study used (quasi)experimental research design; (3) mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention was applied as the main intervention; and (4) study presented pre- and post-intervention measures and quantitative results of stress. The systematic review of eight articles included in the analysis revealed that MBIs were effective in reducing police officers' stress and other stress-related outcomes (sleep problems, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), negative affect, burnout).\n",

      "Complementary and Integrative Medicine in Pancreatic Cancer.\n",
      "Pancreatic cancer has high mortality and morbidity rates, associated with the issues of typically late diagnosis and the limited effectiveness of current treatments. Patients tend to experience multiple symptoms that can include anxiety, fear, depression, fatigue, weakness, peripheral neuropathy, and abdominal pain, which reduce quality of life (QoL) and may compromise the treatment continuum. Many of those symptoms are amenable to complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) therapies as a part of supportive and palliative care. This article reviews research findings on the beneficial effect of use of CIM modalities in regard to pancreatic cancer, with emphasis on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\n",
      "Given the often-poor prognosis of the disease, patients with PDAC often seek integrative therapies to help manage the disease itself, to provide support through cancer treatment and its symptoms, and to provide emotional stress relief. Data is accumulating in the past few years on the potential benefits of CIM to the management of pancreatic cancer symptoms and treatment side effects, in order to augment supportive care. This data reveal that nutrition counselling; digestive enzyme therapy; microbiome support; dietary supplements; lifestyle interventions (physical activity and circadian health/sleep hygiene) appear to improve QoL of these patients through reduced symptom burden and meeting psychological needs, such as distress and fatigue. Acupuncture, mindfulness, yoga, reflexology, massage, and homeopathy may also contribute to symptom reduction, both physical and psychological, in all stages of the disease. There is supporting evidence that some CIM modalities may alleviate side effects and symptoms related to pancreatic cancer and its treatment, suggesting that practitioners might consider integrating these modalities in certain situations encountered in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Further investigation is needed to define the optimal integration of CIM into the treatment and supportive care of patients affected by pancreatic cancer.\n",

      "Cortisol excess in chronic kidney disease - A review of changes and impact on mortality.\n",
      "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) describes the long-term condition of impaired kidney function from any cause. CKD is common and associated with a wide array of complications including higher mortality, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, aberrant immune function, cognitive impairment, mood disturbances and poor sleep quality. Glucocorticoids are endogenous pleiotropic steroid hormones and their excess produces a pattern of morbidity that possesses considerable overlap with CKD. Circulating levels of cortisol, the major active glucocorticoid in humans, are determined by a complex interplay between several processes. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) regulates cortisol synthesis and release, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes mediate metabolic interconversion between active and inactive forms, and clearance from the circulation depends on irreversible metabolic inactivation in the liver followed by urinary excretion. Chronic stress, inflammatory states and other aspects of CKD can disturb these processes, enhancing cortisol secretion \n",

      "Women's mood at high altitude. sexual dimorphism in hypoxic stress modulation by the tryptophan-melatonin axis.\n",
      "Sexual (and gender)-dimorphism in tolerance to hypobaric hypoxia increasingly matters for a differential surveillance of human activities at high altitude (HA). At low altitudes, the prevalence of anxiety and depression in women has already been found to double when compared with men; it could be expected to even increase on exposure to HA. In purposefully caring for the health of women at HA, the present work explores the potential involvement of the tryptophan (Trp)-melatonin axis in mood changes on exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. The present work highlights some already known anxiogenic effects of HA exposure. Hypoxia and insomnia reduce serotonin (5-HT) availability; the latter defect being expressed as failure of brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and mood disorders. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep organization and synapsis restoration that are additionally affected by hypoxia impair memory consolidation. Affective complaints may thus surge, evolving into anxiety and depression. Sex-related differences in neural network organization and hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, and certainly also during the life cycle, underscore the possibility of 5-HT-related mood alterations, particularly in women on HA exposure. The mean brain rate of 5-HT synthesis at sea level is already 1.5-fold higher in males than in females. sexual dimorphism also evidences the overexpression effects of SERT, a 5-HT transporter protein. Gonadal and thyroid hormones, as influenced by HA exposure, further modulate 5-HT availability and its effects in women. Besides caring for adequate oxygenation and maintenance of one's body core temperature, special precautions concerning women sojourning at HA should include close observations of hormonal cycles and, perhaps, also trials with targeted antidepressants.\n",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic altered work environments of nurses, yielding high rates of stress and burnout. Potential protective factors, including effective sleep, may influence psychological health and wellbeing. Evidence about sleep in nurses may help develop interventions that mitigate burnout and poor psychological outcomes. A cross sectional survey was distributed across three hospitals to nurses in New York City (NYC). During the first wave of the pandemic (March-April 2020), NYC had the highest incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (915/100 000) and half of all COVID-related deaths nationwide. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine associations between Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global sleep score, PSQI sleep dimensions, and psychological health (burnout, depression, anxiety, and compassion fatigue), unadjusted and then controlling for individual and professional characteristics. More than half of the participants reported burnout (64%), depression, (67%), and anxiety (77%). Eighty percent of participants had PSQI global scores >5 (poor sleep) (mean 9.27, \n",

      "Sleep quality is an important dimension of sleep health. There are few studies on the relationship between residential environment and sleep quality in China. We validated the connection between them and explored the moderating role of spatial-geographic characteristics and the role of emotional stress and somatic function as mediators.\n",
      "Using survey data collected by the Chinese General Social Survey in 2021, 2717 respondents were included in the analysis. First, OLS regression was used for baseline analysis. Second, a generalized ordered logit model was used to analyze the more precise correlations between residential environmental health and sleep quality. Finally, the mediating role of emotional stress and somatic function was explored using the KHB method.\n",
      "In the baseline analysis, both the positive correlations of residential natural environmental health and residential health resources on people's sleep quality were tested. Further analysis revealed that the correlation of natural environmental health was more about protecting people from poor sleep quality (having \"good\" and \"very good\" sleep quality). The residential health resources correlated with whether people reported very good sleep quality. Regional development disparities played a negative moderating role in the relationship between residential health resources and sleep quality. Also, the mediating role of emotional stress and somatic function were supported, and the mediating role of somatic function was higher in proportion.\n",
      "Sleep quality was positively correlated with residential environmental health; the economic development gap between regions played a moderating role; and the correlation was generated by people's emotional stress and somatic function. In the development of public health policy, it is necessary to actively address various environmental issues, provide convenient health facilities in living spaces, and bolster the policy inclinations of less developed areas.\n",

      "An unhealthy lifestyle has a critical role in the pathogenesis and course of several chronic disorders. It has been hypothesized that lifestyle may also impact biological systems involved in stress response. A global index of unhealthy lifestyle was calculated based on the cumulative presence of five self-reported lifestyle habits (smoking, excessive alcohol use, drug use, low physical activity and short sleep) in 2783 participants (18-65 years) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. The functioning of biological stress systems was based on multiple physiological measures of cortisol, inflammatory cytokines and autonomic cardiac activity. The unhealthy lifestyle index was associated with hyperactivity of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and increased inflammation, indicating that with increasing unhealthy habits, the level of biological stress increases. No association with the autonomic nervous system activity was observed; however, the use of drugs increased parasympathetic cardiac activity and significantly impacted on ANS. Results were not impacted by a recent episode of depression or anxiety disorder. An unhealthy lifestyle may unfavorably impact on biological systems involved in stress response, which may underlie progression of several psychiatric as well as somatic chronic disorders.\n",

      "A Descriptive Comparative Pilot Study: Association Between Use of a Self-monitoring Device and Sleep and Stress Outcomes in Pregnancy.\n",
      "Pregnancy is a challenging time for maintaining quality sleep and managing stress. Digital self-monitoring technologies are popular because of assumed increased patient engagement leading to an impact on health outcomes. However, the actual association between wear time of such devices and improved sleep/stress outcomes remains untested. Here, a descriptive comparative pilot study of 20 pregnant women was conducted to examine associations between wear time (behavioral engagement) of self-monitoring devices and sleep/stress pregnancy outcomes. Women used a ring fitted to their finger to monitor sleep/stress data, with access to a self-monitoring program for an average of 9½ weeks. Based on wear time, participants were split into two engagement groups. Using a linear mixed-effects model, the high engagement group showed higher levels of stress and a negative trend in sleep duration and quality. The low engagement group showed positive changes in sleep duration, and quality and experienced below-normal sleep onset latency at the start of the pilot but trended toward normal levels. Engagement according to device wear time was not associated with improved outcomes. Further research should aim to understand how engagement with self-monitoring technologies impacts sleep/stress outcomes in pregnancy.\n",

      "Do \"central sensitization\" questionnaires reflect measures of nociceptive sensitization or psychological constructs? A systematic review and meta-analyses.\n",
      "Central sensitization (CS) is defined as an increased nociceptive responsiveness due to sensitization of neurons in the central nervous system, usually the result of prolonged nociceptive input or a disease state associated with noxious inputs (eg, polyarthritis). The concept of CS has recently been adopted in clinical assessments of chronic pain, but its diagnosis in humans may now include a wide range of hypervigilant responses. The purpose of this review is to ascertain whether self-report questionnaires linked with CS are associated with enhanced nociceptive responses or whether they measure sensitivity in a broader sense (ie, emotional responses). According to our published, PROSPERO-registered review protocol (CRD42021208731), a predefined search of studies that involve the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) or Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ), correlated with either nociceptive sensory tests or emotional hypervigilance was conducted on MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Correlations between the CSI or PSQ with our primary outcomes were extracted and meta-analysed. A review of 66 studies totalling 13,284 participants found that the CSI (but not the PSQ) strongly correlated with psychological constructs: depression, anxiety, stress, pain catastrophising, sleep, and kinesiophobia. The CSI and PSQ showed weak or no correlations with experimental measures of nociceptive sensitivity: pain thresholds, temporal summation, or conditioned pain modulation. The PSQ did, however, correlate strongly with phasic heat and tonic cold pain tests. The studies reviewed did not provide sufficient evidence that self-report measures reflect a canonical understanding of CS. The CSI more closely reflects psychological hypervigilance than increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons.\n",

      "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-related pulmonary hypertension (PH) can often be reversed with treatment of OSA via continuous positive airway pressure. We hypothesized that treatment of OSA would be associated with a greater improvement in exercise capacity (EC) with cardiac rehabilitation (CR), especially in patients with PH as compared with those who are untreated.\n",
      "We reviewed medical records of 315 consecutive patients who participated in CR. Pulmonary hypertension status was assessed on the basis of peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity (>2.8 m/sec) on pre-CR echocardiograms. The OSA status (no, untreated, or treated OSA) was determined on the basis of results from sleep studies, continuous positive airway pressure device data, and physician notes. Exercise capacity was assessed by measuring metabolic equivalents (METs) using a treadmill stress test before and after CR.\n",
      "We included 290 patients who participated in CR with available echocardiographic data: 44 (15%) had PH, and 102 (35%) had known OSA (30 treated and 72 untreated). Patients with OSA versus those with no OSA were more likely to have PH (P = .06). Patients with PH versus no-PH were associated with significantly lower baseline METs in crude and adjusted analyses (P ≤. 004). The PH and OSA status in isolation were not associated with changes in METs (P > .2) with CR. There was a significant interaction between OSA treatment and PH in crude and adjusted analyses (P ≤.01): treatment vs no treatment of OSA was associated with a clinically and statistically greater improvement in METs in patients who participated in CR with but not without PH.\n",

      "The incidence of overweight and obesity is alarming worldwide. In Argentina, multifactorial studies are scarce despite the high rates of childhood overweight and obesity (OW/OB). In this study we assessed the prevalence of childhood OW/OB and the associated risk factors from a multicausal perspective: we analyzed sleep habits, screen use, chronic stress in children and their caregivers, social relationship problems, eating habits, and physical activity. Of the 397 first and seventh graders who completed the questionnaires, 41% had childhood OW/OB. In children with obesity, a lower level of physical activity, a lower consumption of protective foods, a higher risk for sleep disorders, higher levels of chronic stress (in both children and their caregivers), and higher rates of peer rejection were observed. Widespread use of screens before bedtime was noted in most children. This study evidences the diversity of factors associated with childhood OW/OB and highlights the convenience of a multidimensional approach to address it. In addition, the results of this study suggest the need to consider lifestyle habits as a preventive and therapeutic strategy for the management of OW/OB from early stages.\n",
      "La incidencia de sobrepeso y obesidad es alarmante en el mundo. En Argentina son escasos los estudios multifactoriales a pesar de los altos índices de sobrepeso y obesidad en la población infantil (SOI). En este estudio evaluamos la prevalencia de SOI y sus factores de riesgo asociados desde una perspectiva multicausal: analizamos hábitos de sueño, uso de pantallas, estrés crónico en niños y sus cuidadores, problemas de relación social, alimentación y actividad física. De los 397 niños de primer y séptimo grado que completaron los cuestionarios, el 41 % presentó SOI. Los niños con obesidad mostraron realizar menos actividad física, tener un menor consumo de alimentos protectores, más riesgos de trastornos del sueño, mayores niveles de estrés crónico (tanto en los niños como en sus cuidadores) y mayor índice de rechazo entre pares. En la mayoría de los niños se encontró un uso generalizado de pantallas antes de acostarse. El presente estudio evidencia la diversidad de factores asociados a esta problemática y destaca la conveniencia de utilizar un enfoque multidimensional para abordar la obesidad en la infancia. Asimismo, los resultados de este trabajo sugieren la necesidad de considerar los hábitos de vida como estrategia preventiva y terapéutica para el tratamiento de esta enfermedad desde etapas tempranas.\n",

      "Since its discovery in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been affecting humanity in economic, social, physical, and psychological manner. During COVID-19, the older population needs special consideration since they have a greater risk of developing serious illnesses. We used a narrative review approach to identify the relevant articles. PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched for the following keywords: (mental health OR mental illness(es) OR anxiety OR depression OR irritability) AND (elderly OR older people OR aged 60 years or more) AND (Covid-19 OR pandemic OR chronic diseases) AND (mitigate OR manage). In the initial search, we found 948 articles related to our search string, and only 33 studies were included in this narrative review. The results demonstrated that the elderly population is more prone to mental health issues associated with COVID-19. This narrative review also reported that loneliness, stress, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and suicidal ideation symptoms are experienced by the elderly during the pandemic. Our results also demonstrate that interventions, such as community activities through social interactions, and the use of digital technologies could improve the quality of life of older people and help in the mitigation and management of the adverse effects of COVID-19.\n",

Specific guidelines on the health surveillance of BrS workers are lacking. We report here three cases requiring assessment of specific job capacity, investigated with an interdisciplinary protocol including 24-hour Holter electrocardiography with modified precordial leads, pharmacological test with ajmaline, molecular genetic analysis, electrophysiological study with ventricular stimulation, risk stratification, and occupational medicine evaluation: (1) a female 42 yr-old company manager with positive ajmaline test and CACNA1C gene mutation (judged fit for the job with limitations regarding work-related stress); (2) a male 44 yr-old welder with positive ajmaline test, SCN5A gene mutation, and associated OSAS (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome), who was advised to refrain from night shifts and driving company vehicles; (3) a male 45 yr-old electrical technician with inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmia, who was implanted with a biventricular cardioverter defibrillator, and therefore recommended to avoid exposure to electromagnetic fields and working at heights. We conclude that the collaboration between the cardiologist and the occupational physician allows defining the functional capabilities and the arrhythmogenic risk of BrS workers, to optimize job fitness assessment.\n",

      "Reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Nightmare disorder index in adolescents.\n",
      "The Nightmare Disorder Index Questionnaire (NDI) was developed to measure the impact of nightmares. The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of NDI among Chinese adolescents. This study investigated the validity and internal consistency of the Nightmare Disorder Index Chinese (NDI-CV) among 6014 Chinese adolescents who completed the NDI-CV, Nightmare Distress Questionnaire-Chinese Version (NDQ-CV), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Chinese Adolescent Daytime Sleepiness Scale (CADSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Questionnaire (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). In addition, we investigated the test-retest reliability of the NDI-CV among 423 adolescents who completed a retest of the NDI-CV after a 2-week interval. Finally, NDI-CV demonstrated good psychometric properties in a sample of Chinese adolescents (Cronbach's α coefficient of 0.876), and the 95% confidence interval for the 2-week retest correlation coefficient was 0.675-0.977 (p < 0.001).\n",

      "This work aimed to assess the therapeutic and economic benefits of service dogs versus emotional support dogs for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n",
      "Veterans with PTSD (N=227) participating in a multicenter trial were randomly assigned to receive a service or emotional support dog; 181 veterans received a dog and were followed up for 18 months. Primary outcomes included overall functioning (assessed with World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale II [WHODAS 2.0]) and quality of life (Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey [VR-12]). Secondary outcomes included PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5), suicidal ideation, depression, sleep quality, health care costs and utilization, medication adherence, employment, and productivity.\n",
      "Participants paired with a dog had a mean±SD age of 50.6±13.6 years (range 22-79), and most were male (80%), White (66%), and non-Hispanic (91%). Adjusted linear mixed repeated-measures models indicated no difference between the two groups on WHODAS 2.0 or VR-12 scores. Participants with service dogs had a 3.7-point greater reduction in PTSD symptoms versus participants with emotional support dogs (p=0.036). No reduced health care utilization or cost was associated with receiving a service dog. Veterans with service dogs had an increase of 10 percentage points in antidepressant adherence compared with those with emotional support dogs (p<0.01).\n",
      "Both groups appeared to benefit from having a service or emotional support dog. No significant differences in improved functioning or quality of life were observed between the groups. Those in the service dog group had a greater reduction in PTSD symptoms and better antidepressant adherence, improvements that should be explored further.\n",

Managing fatigue and promoting work engagement, teachers' expectations and perceptions can impact work-related stress-recovery-balance and physical activity levels. The main objective of the current study was to investigate the relationship between intrinsic motivational factors and the autonomic nervous system, such as heart rate and heart rate variability regulation, sleep, and physical activity levels.\n",
      "The research included 66 primary and high school teachers in Tampere, Finland, in 2020-2021. The Reiss Motivation Profile® (RMP) was selected as an instrument to provide a practical approach to understanding people's intrinsic motivators and the effects of those on the Firstbeat®-measured heart rate and heart rate variability, and accelerometry. Stepwise multiple linear regression models were used to assess whether the RMP motives reflected Firstbeat®-measured outcomes.\n",
      "Motives such as Acceptance, Eating, Family, Physical Activity, Power, Tranquillity, and Vengeance were found to have a relationship with Firstbeat®-measured outcomes. An increase in the Physical Activity motive was related to lower stress and less light physical activity. Furthermore, an increase in the Physical Activity motive showed a relationship with better recovery and a higher amount of vigorous physical activity.

Trips were categorized as <3, 3 to 6, 6 to 9, or 9+ time zone changes, along with travel direction (eastward or westward). The pretravel to posttravel changes in perceptual ratings at days 1 and 2 postarrival were compared between time zone change and travel direction with linear mixed models.\n",

However, the models explained only small proportions of the variation in postflight perceptual responses (7%-18%). Regardless, travel across 9+ time zones resulted in significantly worse perceived fatigue, sleep, and total wellness for days 1 and 2 postarrival compared with travel with <6 time zones (P < .05). Additionally, fatigue, sleep, and total scores were worse on day 2 following trips of 9+ time zones. Eastward travel resulted in poorer sleep ratings (β = 0.52, P < .001) than westward travel within time zone groupings.\n",

      "Effectiveness of one-week internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia to prevent progression from acute to chronic insomnia: A two-arm, multi-center, randomized controlled trial.\n",
      "Acute insomnia is common and a substantial proportion of people with acute insomnia (i.e. 3 days to 3 months) transit into chronic insomnia (i.e. 3 months or longer). Therefore, early intervention for acute insomnia is vital to prevent chronicity. Previous trials with small sample sizes have shown that brief versions of both individual and group-based face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can improve insomnia symptoms among those with acute insomnia. However, it is unknown whether one-week internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective in treating acute insomnia. This was a randomized controlled trial and 192 participants were randomly assigned to the CBT-I group (n = 95) or control group (n = 97). The primary outcome was the incidence of chronic insomnia, determined via a structured diagnostic questionnaire for insomnia disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Secondary outcomes were Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Sleep Hygiene and Practices Scale (SHPS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Short-Form 12-Item Health Survey version 2 (SF-12v2). At week 12, the incidence of chronic insomnia was significantly lower in the CBT-I group compared with control group (33.3% [27/81] vs. 65.8% [52/79]). Participants in the CBT-I group achieved significantly more improvements in ISI, ESS, PSAS, FIRST, SHPS, HADS-Depression, and the mental component summary and physical component summary of SF-12v2 than control group, but not DBAS and HADS-Anxiety. This one-week internet-delivered CBT-I program is an effective tool to prevent the chronicity of acute insomnia.\n",

      "Melatonin: a potential therapeutic approach for the management of primary Sjögren's syndrome.\n",
      "Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the exocrine glands and is mainly characterized by sicca symptoms of the eyes and mouth. Approximately 30-50% of pSS patients develop systemic multi-organ disorders including malignant lymphoma. The etiology of pSS is not well understood; growing evidence suggests that uncontrolled immune/inflammatory responses, excessive oxidative stress, defected apoptosis, dysregulated autophagy, exosomes, and exogenous virus infections may participate in the pathogenesis of pSS. There is no ideal therapeutic method for pSS; the management of pSS is mainly palliative, which aims to alleviate sicca symptoms. Melatonin, as the main secretory product of the pineal gland, has been evidenced to show various physiological functions, including effects of immunoregulation, capability of antioxidation, moderation of autophagy, suppressive activities of apoptosis, regulative capacity of exosomes, properties of anti-infection, and improvement of sleep. The beneficial effects of melatonin have been already validated in some autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, our previous research firstly revealed that melatonin might inhibit pathogenic responses of peripheral Th17 and double-negative (DN) T cells in pSS. More importantly, melatonin administration alleviated the development of pSS in animal models with reduced infiltrating lymphocytes, improved functional activity of salivary gland, and decreased production of inflammatory factors as well as autoantibodies. Owing to the important biological properties reported in melatonin are characteristics closely related to the treatment of pSS; the potential role and underlying mechanisms of melatonin in the administration of pSS are certainly worth further investigations. Consequently, the aim of this review is to give a deep insight to the therapeutic potency of melatonin for pSS.\n",

      "Normal range CAG repeat size variations in the HTT gene are associated with an adverse lipoprotein profile partially mediated by body mass index.\n",
      "Tandem CAG repeat sizes of 36 or more in the huntingtin gene (HTT) cause Huntington disease. Apart from neuropsychiatric complications, the disease is also accompanied by metabolic dysregulation and weight loss, which contribute to a progressive functional decline. Recent studies also reported an association between repeats below the pathogenic threshold (<36) for Huntington's disease and body mass index (BMI), suggesting that HTT repeat sizes in the non-pathogenic range are associated with metabolic dysregulation. In this study we hypothesized that HTT repeat sizes < 36 are associated with metabolite levels, possibly mediated through reduced BMI. We pooled data from three European cohorts (n = 10 228) with genotyped HTT CAG repeat size and metabolomic measurements. All 145 metabolites were measured on the same targeted platform in all studies. Multilevel mixed-effects analysis using the CAG repeat size in HTT identified 67 repeat size-metabolite associations. Overall, the metabolomic profile associated with larger CAG repeat sizes in HTT were unfavorable-similar to those of higher risk of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes-and included elevated levels of amino acids, fatty acids, LDL, VLDL and IDL related metabolites whilst with decreased levels of very large HDL related metabolites. Furthermore, the associations of 50 metabolites, in particular specific very large HDL related metabolites, were mediated by lower BMI. However, no mediation effect was found for 17 metabolites related to LDL and IDL. In conclusion, our findings indicate that large non-pathogenic CAG repeat sizes in HTT are associated with an unfavorable metabolomic profile despite their association with a lower BMI.\n",

      "Burnout and the Quantified Workplace: Tensions around Personal Sensing Interventions for Stress in Resident Physicians.\n",
      "Recent research has explored computational tools to manage workplace stress via personal sensing, a measurement paradigm in which behavioral data streams are collected from technologies including smartphones, wearables, and personal computers. As these tools develop, they invite inquiry into how they can be appropriately implemented towards improving workers' well-being. In this study, we explored this proposition through formative interviews followed by a design provocation centered around measuring burnout in a U.S. resident physician program. Residents and their supervising attending physicians were presented with medium-fidelity mockups of a dashboard providing behavioral data on residents' sleep, activity and time working; self-reported data on residents' levels of burnout; and a free text box where residents could further contextualize their well-being. Our findings uncover tensions around how best to measure workplace well-being, who within a workplace is accountable for worker stress, and how the introduction of such tools remakes the boundaries of appropriate information flows between worker and workplace. We conclude by charting future work confronting these tensions, to ensure personal sensing is leveraged to truly improve worker well-being.\n",

      "Decreased psychological and cognitive functioning is one of the complications of Covid-19 disease. We aimed to evaluate mental health, cognitive functioning, and salivary cortisol levels in Covid-19 patients with different disease severities in three 45-day intervals after recovery.\n",
      "258 Covid-19 patients were assigned into three groups based on their disease severity: 112 patients in mild group, 67 patients in moderate group and 79 patients in severe group. The participants underwent psychological evaluations (including Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, SpeilBerger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory), cognitive assessments (The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) and salivary cortisol level evaluation in three 45-day periods. Non-parametric statistical methods were applied for psychological and cognitive indicators, while two-way mixed model ANOVA was used to evaluate the cortisol concentration in three replications.\n",
      "The group of mild patients became more anxious and the group of moderate patients became more anxious and depressed. But all three groups of patients developed severe sleep disorders over time. For cognitive functioning, although the results showed a decrease in the correct response rate, a significant increase in the correct response rate was observed in all three groups in all three measurements. However, the response speed not only did not increase, but also decreased in severe group. Cortisol level had a markedly increasing trend in all three groups.\n",
      "Improvement of cognitive functioning was in line with the increase in cortisol. Besides, the decrease in mental health had no effect on the cognitive functioning.\n",

      "The Development of Psychiatric Illness and Chemoprophylaxis of Botulinum Toxin in Migraine: A Narrative Review.\n",
      "A migraine is not just a headache. It is an extremely prevalent neurological condition marked by periodic episodes of unilateral headache, with more than 10 million cases yearly. Migraine often begins at the age of puberty. It substantially impacts the brain and, consequently, psychiatric behavior linked with frequent migraine attacks that may be moderate to severe in intensity. A crucial aspect of migraine variability is comorbidity with other neurological diseases, vascular diseases, and mental illnesses. Psychiatric disorders related to migraine include anxiety disorders, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, etc. It is also estimated that people suffering from migraine are about five times more likely to develop depression than others without migraine. The stimulus for migraine is stress, lack of sleep, skipped meal or fasting, visual stimulation due to high intensity of light, auditory stimulus due to noise, and olfactory stimulus due to a pungent smell. A majority of patients suffer from migraine attacks triggered by noise, some due to visual stimulation, and a few due to perfumes or other odors that trigger their migraine. Diagnosis of this is primarily dependent on history taking and clinical evaluation. Migraine can be classified depending on whether an aura is present or absent. It can further be divided based on the frequency of headaches into episodic migraine or chronic migraine, which may be determined by the duration of the headache. The development of migraine is influenced by both genetics and the environment. It has a detrimental effect on children's quality of life. A comprehensive analysis of psychiatric illnesses in migraine contributes to early diagnosis and proper treatment of the disease. Also, having a healthy lifestyle (including exercise, a balanced diet, and enough sleep) seems to prevent and improve the condition. Headache in migraine is resistant to medical treatment but responds well to botulinum toxin. This review primarily focuses on the psychiatric issues like depression and anxiety that often accompany migraine. The article also highlights the effects of botulinum toxin on migraine.\n",

      "This study aimed to explore the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain and investigate how sleep and psychological factors influence musculoskeletal pain in a nursing group.\n",
      "Nordic standard questionnaires were distributed to 230 female nurses. Chi-square tests were performed to assess the associations between sleep problems, psychological problems, and musculoskeletal pain symptoms. Binary logistic regression analysis was also conducted to identify the primary factors influencing the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain.\n",
      "The highest prevalence of pain was observed in the lower back, neck, and shoulders, whereas the lowest prevalence of pain was observed in the ankles, feet, elbows, and hips/buttocks. Chi-square analysis and binary logistic regression showed that sleep duration, sleep onset time, and sleep quality all significantly contributed to the development of neck and upper back pain. With regard to the psychological factors, only occupational pride and stress had a significant effect on pain; in contrast, family support did not show any significant influence.\n",
      "Compared with other body regions, musculoskeletal pain in the lower back, neck, and shoulders requires more attention and preventive interventions. Special efforts should be made to shift the workday system of the nursing group because of the strong correlation between sleep problems and pain. Incentives other than penalty mechanisms should be considered seriously in nursing to boost occupational pride and relieve job stress.\n",

      "The study aimed to identify the factors associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress in Brazilian mothers of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study carried in 2020 with the participation of 822 mothers who answered an online questionnaire containing sociodemographic variables and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The adjusted model showed a higher depression score in women who became unemployed during the pandemic, who felt a greater burden in taking care of children, who took medication on a regular basis, and who self-assessed their health as regular or poor/very poor. Having a lower family income increased their anxiety scale score. In contrast, the variables associated with a reduced anxiety scale score included greater age, not feeling overwhelmed with demands to care for children, not using medications, not having gastrointestinal diseases, and good/very good self-assessed health. These variables, together with the benefits of living in the Northeast and Midwest regions of Brazil as well as sleeping more hours per night, were also associated with reduced stress. The present study is significant as it points out elements present in the daily lives of mothers that have an impact on their mental health. The study points to the need to (re)think mental health policies taking into account the needs of the public studied.\n",

      "A comparison of sleep restriction and sleep compression on objective measures of sleep: A sub-sample from a large randomised controlled trial.\n",
      "Sleep restriction therapy is a central component of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, but can lead to excessive sleepiness, which may impede treatment adherence. Sleep compression therapy has been suggested as a possibly gentler alternative. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of sleep restriction therapy and sleep compression therapy on objective measures of sleep, with a focus on magnitude and timing of effects. From a larger study of participants with insomnia, a sub-sample of 36 underwent polysomnographic recordings, before being randomised to either sleep restriction (n = 19) or sleep compression (n = 17) and receiving online treatment for 10 weeks. Assessments with polysomnography were also carried out after 2, 5, and 10 weeks of treatment. Data were analysed with multilevel linear mixed effect modelling. As per treatment instructions, participants in sleep restriction initially spent shorter time in bed compared with sleep compression. Participants in sleep restriction also showed an initial decrease of total sleep time, which was not seen in the sleep compression group. Both treatments led to improvements in sleep continuity variables, with a tendency for the improvements to come earlier during treatment in sleep restriction. No substantial differences were found between the two treatments 10 weeks after the treatment start. The results indicate that homeostatic sleep pressure may not be as important as a mechanism in sleep compression therapy as in sleep restriction therapy, and an investigation of other mechanisms is needed. In conclusion, the treatments led to similar changes in objective sleep at a somewhat different pace, and possibly through different mechanisms.\n",

      "Investigating sleep, stress, and mood dynamics via temporal network analysis.\n",
      "Prior research has emphasized the bidirectional relationships between sleep, stress, and affective states, such as depression. Given the inherent variability and fluctuations associated with sleep, assessing how sleep and affective variables function within a dynamic system may help further uncover possible causes and consequences of sleep disturbances, as well as find candidate targets for intervention. To this end, we examined dynamic relationships between self-reported stress, depressed mood, and clinically-relevant sleep parameters via temporal network analysis.\n",
      "Participants were 401 nurses (92% female, 78% White, M\n",
      "Overall, total sleep time emerged as a highly influential variable in the context of \"outstrength centrality,\" meaning total sleep time had numerous outward connections with other variables (e.g., stress and sleep efficiency). The high outstrength centrality of total sleep time suggests this variable is a source of activation within this dynamic system. Conversely, stress showed high \"instrength centrality,\" suggesting this variable was highly impacted by other variables in the system, such as depressed mood and sleep efficiency. These findings emphasize the importance of assessing unfolding sleep processes within a naturalistic setting, and implicate the role of total sleep time in fueling depressed mood and stress. Discussion emphasizes implications of these results for understanding the connections between sleep, stress, and depression as well as clinical relevance of these findings.\n",

      "This systematic review aims to explore the prevalence of the impact of the COVID-19, MERS, and SARS pandemics on the mental health of pregnant women.\n",
      "All COVID-19, SARS and MERS studies that evaluated the mental health of pregnant women with/without gynaecological conditions that were reported in English between December 2000 - July 2021 were included. The search criteria were developed based upon the research question using PubMed, Science Direct, Ovid PsycINFO and EMBASE databases. A wide search criterion was used to ensure the inclusion of all pregnant women with existing gynaecological conditions. The Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale was used to assess the risk of bias for all included studies. Random effects model with restricted maximum-likelihood estimation method was applied for the meta-analysis and I-square statistic was used to evaluate heterogeneity across studies. The pooled prevalence rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, stress, and sleep disorders with 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed.\n",
      "This systematic review identified 217 studies which included 638,889 pregnant women or women who had just given birth. There were no studies reporting the mental health impact due to MERS and SARS. Results showed that women who were pregnant or had just given birth displayed various symptoms of poor mental health including those relating to depression (24.9%), anxiety (32.8%), stress (29.44%), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (27.93%), and sleep disorders (24.38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "It is important to note that studies included in this review used a range of outcome measures which does not allow for direct comparisons between findings. Most studies reported self-reported measure of symptoms without clinical diagnoses so conclusions can be made for symptom prevalence rather than of mental illness. The importance of managing mental health during pregnancy and after-delivery improves the quality of life and wellbeing of mothers hence developing an evidence-based approached as part of pandemic preparedness would improve mental health during challenging times.\n",
      "The work presented in this manuscript was not funded by any specific grants. A study protocol was developed and published in PROSPERO (CRD42021235356) to explore several key objectives.\n",

      "Sleep timing, chronotype, and posttraumatic stress disorder: An individual participant data meta-analysis.\n",
      "Sleep disturbance is a major component of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The role of circadian disruption is largely overlooked, though many PTSD studies collect proxy markers of circadian timing. This individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis examined the correlation between sleep timing / chronotype and PTSD severity among individuals diagnosed with PTSD, the standardized mean difference in sleep timing / chronotype for individuals with and without PTSD, and moderators of these relationships. A systematic search was conducted; authors provided IPD for 27 studies and aggregate data for 16 studies (3,011 participants with PTSD; 2,703 participants without PTSD). Two-step meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects multivariate approach with robust variance estimation. Bedtime and wake time were not significantly associated with PTSD symptoms or diagnosis. Less total sleep time / time in bed was weakly associated with greater PTSD symptoms. Moderator analyses revealed that effect sizes were stronger in certain populations and when using wrist actigraphy to measure sleep timing; however, gap maps revealed few studies in moderator categories with the strongest effects. Only two studies measured chronotype, prohibiting strong conclusions. Our findings indicate that the relationship between sleep timing and PTSD is weak; however, key gaps in the literature warrant further study.\n",

The control group received routine nursing, and the observation group received nursing intervention based on continuity model. The physiological function recovery, psychological stress, negative psychology, trait coping style and quality of life were compared between the 2 groups. Compared with the control group, the first time to get out of bed, the time to subside swelling of upper limb and the length of hospital stay in the experimental group were significantly shorter, the sleep time was significantly longer, and the visual analog scale score was significantly lower in the experimental group (all P < .05). After receiving nursing intervention, the psychological stress scores of somatizations, anxiety and depression of all patients were significantly lower than before nursing, and the above scores of the observation group were significantly lower than those of the control group (all P < .05). After nursing, the positive coping score, negative coping score and quality of life score of all patients were significantly higher than those before nursing, and the above scores of the observation group were significantly higher than those of the control group (all P < .05). Nursing intervention based on continuity model can promote the recovery of physical function, improve psychological stress and negative emotions, and improve the quality of life of patients with RA, which is worthy of clinical application.\n",

      "The journey of five to six years of medical school is a mixture of different emotions ranging from happiness to stress, anxiety and even mental breakdowns. Diet, sleep and exercise are considered to be three integral components of a healthy life which are often neglected by us, as medical students mostly as a result of such emotional changes in their life. We need a good anount of nutrition to maintain the energy levels for our day-to-day chores, adequate sleep for proper functioning of body and mind and exercise to keep us energized throughout the day. A healthy lifestyle is something that every individual strive towards in their life and as medical students we must always consider about having a healthy lifestyle by balancing our diet, sleep, and exercise.\n",

      "The multifactorial complexities of autoimmune development in Pemphigus vulgaris: Critical evaluation of the role of environmental and lifestyle \"exposome\" factors.\n",
      "Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a potentially life-threatening blistering disorder characterized by autoantibodies directed against cell-cell adhesion molecules that serves as an excellent model to study human autoimmune development. Numerous studies have identified specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes, in particular DRB1*0402 and DQB1*0503, that confer disease risk. Although HLA is required, it is not sufficient for the initiation of disease. As with all autoimmune diseases, the etio-pathogenesis of PV is complex, meaning it is multifactorial. Susceptibility is polygenic, and the search for non-HLA disease-linked genes continues. Moreover, twin studies across autoimmune conditions indicate that non-genetic environmental and lifestyle factors, which can be collectively grouped under the term \"exposome\", are also major contributors to disease development. The literature presents evidence for the potential role of multiple triggers such as medications, infections, stress, diet, immunizations, and sleep to influence the etiology, pathophysiology, and prognosis of PV. However, a clear understanding of the degree to which specific factors impact PV is lacking. In this investigation, we comprehensively review the environmental elements listed above and consider the strength of evidence for these factors. The overall goals of this work are to provide greater insights into the factors that influence disease susceptibility, disease development and disease course and ultimately help to better guide clinicians and inform patients in the management of PV.\n",

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of suicidal behavior (SB) among this population and the mediating role of insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress in the relationship between Internet addiction (IA) and SB using a structural equation model.\n",
      "A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among several vocational high school students in Hunan Province, and 7,968 valid questionnaires were obtained. General demographic data and data from the Dual-Mode Self-Control Scale, Athens Insomnia Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress scale-21, and Revised Chen Internet Addiction Scale were collected. A structural equation model was used to explore the different pathways from IA to SB.\n",
      "Among the participants, 37.7, 15.7, and 21.8% reported suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts, respectively. The structural equation model confirmed that IA was indirectly related to SB and was mediated by insomnia and/or depression, anxiety, and stress.\n",
      "First, we only recruited students from vocational schools in Hunan Province, therefore, the sample may not represent the entire population of vocational students in China. Second, self-report scales were used in this study, and clinical diagnosis required professional interviews. Third, since this study had a cross-sectional design, the causal relationship between the variables could not be determined.\n",
      "The prevalence of SB among vocational high school students in China was significantly high. The prevention of SB related to IA can be attributed to the improvement of insomnia and emotional problems.\n",

      "The shared molecular mechanisms underlying aging of the brain, major depressive disorder, and Alzheimer's disease: The role of circadian rhythm disturbances.\n",
      "An association with circadian clock function and pathophysiology of aging, major depressive disorder (MDD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established and has been proposed as a factor in the development of these diseases. Depression and changes in circadian rhythm have been increasingly suggested as the two primary overlapping and interpenetrating changes that occur with aging. The relationship between AD and depression in late life is not completely understood and probably is complex. Patients with major depression or AD suffer from disturbed sleep/wake cycles and altered rhythms in daily activities. Although classical monoaminergic hypotheses are traditionally proposed to explain the pathophysiology of MDD, several clinical and preclinical studies have reported a strong association between circadian rhythm and mood regulation. In addition, a large body of evidence supports an association between disruption of circadian rhythm and AD. Some clock genes are dysregulated in rodent models of depression. If aging, AD, and MDD share a common biological basis in pathophysiology, common therapeutic tools could be investigated for their prevention and treatment. Nitro-oxidative stress (NOS), for example, plays a fundamental role in aging, as well as in the pathogenesis of AD and MDD and is associated with circadian clock disturbances. Thus, development of therapeutic possibilities with these NOS-related conditions is advisable. This review describes recent findings that link disrupted circadian clocks to aging, MDD, and AD and summarizes the experimental evidence that supports connections between the circadian clock and molecular pathologic factors as shared common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying aging, AD, and MDD.\n",

This study sought to replicate and extend these preliminary findings in a new sample of individuals with DS and their families who live in European countries.\n",
      "Study participants were European clinicians and parents caring for individuals with DS who had participated in an EU FFA Early Access Program. Participants completed one-on-one semi-structured interviews and were asked the extent to which they noticed changes in a number of the child's seizure- and non-seizure-related QOL domains after starting FFA treatment. Participants were also asked about the benefits of FFA treatment to the caregivers' lives and for the family unit.\n",
      "25 parent caregivers and 16 clinicians participated. The caregivers and clinicians reported improvements in both seizure-related (i.e., reductions in seizure activity, improvements in the frequency or type of seizure triggers and post-ictal recovery times, and improved post-seizure function) and non-seizure-related (e.g., cognition, focus, alertness, speech, academic performance, behavior, sleep, motor function) QOL domains after FFA treatment in individuals with DS. Caregivers also reported improved mood and more time for things they enjoyed, felt less overwhelmed, reported better sleep quality, and had less personal and family stress; clinicians corroborated most of these reports. All clinicians (100%) and most (96%) caregivers said they would \"very likely\" or \"quite likely\" recommend FFA to others with DS.\n",
      "Real-world experience in Europe with FFA treatment is associated with meaningful improvements in many QOL domains for individuals with DS and their families; replicating findings from a previous study of DS patients and their families from the USA.

      "Pre-sleep arousal induced by suspenseful series and cliffhangers have only minor effects on sleep: A sleep laboratory study.\n",
      "Pre-sleep arousal impairs sleep. Therefore, watching suspenseful TV series before sleep is not recommended as they increase arousal. In particular, the consumption of multiple episodes of the same suspenseful TV series in one sitting - termed binge-watching - could lead to large increases in physiological arousal delaying sleep onset. Furthermore, abrupt endings during critical scenes - termed cliffhangers - result in unfinished story lines, which further increase cognitive arousal and could negatively impact sleep architecture and the number of awakenings. However, the effects of binge-watching and cliffhangers on objective sleep parameters are still unknown. Here we tested in a controlled sleep-laboratory setting whether pre-sleep arousal induced by watching 3-4 episodes of a suspenseful TV series has negative effects on sleep in 50 healthy young participants (39 females, mean age = 22.62 ± 2.60 (SD)). Watching a neutral TV series served as a control condition, according to a within-subject design. In one group of participants, the suspenseful TV series ended with a cliffhanger. In the other group, the same TV series ended where no ongoing action was interrupted. Pre-sleep arousal was measured both subjectively with the self-reported level of stress and objectively with the mean heart rate and cortisol level. As expected, suspenseful TV series induced higher cognitive and physiological pre-sleep arousal than neutral control TV series, with highest values for TV series with cliffhangers. In spite of the high pre-sleep arousal, participants fell asleep faster after watching the suspenseful compared with the neutral TV series (F\n",

      "[Position of the international forum of internal medicine on habits, lifestyle changes and a healthy environment for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases].\n",
      "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), mainly ischemic heart disease and stroke, is the main cause of death worldwide and each year more people die from CVD than from any other cause. These data call for a paradigm shift, where health promotion and cardiovascular prevention will acquire a central role in health policies. From this perspective, dedicating time during the consultation to promoting the acquisition of heart-healthy habits would be indicated in all individuals, regardless of cardiovascular risk classification, the role of the internist being fundamental. This position document from the International Forum of Internal Medicine (FIMI) presents the main indications regarding changes in lifestyle and acquisition of healthy habits to prevent CVD. The different sections will address topics including: nutrition, physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep, stress, environmental problems related to CVD and specific conditions in women. A section is included about starting CVD promotion and prevention measures at an early age, childhood and adolescence, also mentioning epigenetic aspects related to CVD. Social determinants in CVD are also taken into account, since some of these aspects, such as low socioeconomic level, modify cardiovascular risk and should be taken into account.\n",

      "Occupational burnout and chronic fatigue in the work of academic teachers-moderating role of selected health behaviours.\n",
      "Increasing and changing demands for academic teachers worldwide are leading to different consequences, some of which are negative, such as physical and mental health impairment. With the job demands-resources model and the transactional model of occupational stress adopted as a theoretical framework, a cross-sectional study among Polish academic teachers was conducted. The aim of the study is to identify the role of vital personal resources understood as selected health-promoting behaviours, such as (1) stress-coping strategies, (2) sleep hygiene, and (3) using annual vacation leave, in the process of the regeneration. In a cross-sectional survey, the following variables have been assessed: 1) work-related stress using the Psychosocial Risk Scale, 2) occupational burnout using the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), 3) chronic fatigue using the Polish adaptation of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), and selected health behaviours of academic teachers 4) stress-coping strategies with the help of the Polish version of Mini-COPE and 5) rest: the amount of sleep and vacation days devoted to rest using a short questionnaire designed by the authors. The sample (N = 340) was comprised of academic teachers employed at Polish higher education institutions who have experienced changes in the work environment in recent years. We conducted a multiple regression analysis to determine the relationships among stress, burnout, and chronic fatigue, looking at coping strategies and rest as a moderator. The results indicate that there is a strong relationship between stress resulting from an excessively demanding work environment on the one hand and occupational burnout and chronic fatigue on the other. At the same time, selected health behaviours of academic teachers only slightly moderate the analyzed relationship. Avoidance strategies strengthen the relationship between stress and its negative consequences, while rest and-to a limited extent-the amount of sleep only slightly contribute to weakening the analyzed relationship.\n",

      "The Mediating Role of Sleep Disturbance on the Association Between Stress and Self-Rated Health Among Chinese and Korean Immigrant Americans.\n",
      "Disturbed sleep may be a factor that links stress with poor health, especially among groups experiencing high levels of stress caused by racial and ethnic minority and nativity status. The objective of this study was to describe the potential mediating role of sleep disturbance in the associations between various types of stress and self-rated health among Chinese and Korean Americans.\n",
      "Our cross-sectional study consisted of 400 Chinese and Korean immigrants aged 50 to 75 years recruited from August 2018 through June 2020 from physicians' clinics in the Baltimore-Washington, DC, metropolitan area. We used the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) short-form questionnaire to measure sleep disturbance. Linear regression analyses examined associations between 3 types of stress (acculturative stress, perceived stress, and distress) and self-rated health, accounting for demographic, socioeconomic, and health insurance factors. The Karlson-Holm-Breen method was used to estimate the total and direct effects of stresses on self-rated health and the indirect effects of stresses on health through sleep disturbance.\n",
      "Greater acculturative stress (β = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.14), perceived stress (β = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.03-0.08), and distress (β = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.05-0.13) were all associated with poorer self-rated health. Sleep disturbance was a partial mediator, with sleep disturbance accounting for 21.7%, 14.9%, and 18.7% of the associations between acculturative stress, perceived stress, and distress and self-rated health, respectively.\n",
      "Because sleep disturbance partially mediates the associations between stress and poor self-rated health, future interventions and research may consider mitigating sleep disturbances and stress among racial and ethnic minority populations to address health disparities.\n",

      "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has progressively impacted our daily lives, resulting in unexpected physical and mental stress on medical staff. This study is designed to investigate the levels of and risk factors for burnout, depression, anxiety, and insomnia among medical staff during the COVID-19 epidemic breakout in Shanghai, China.\n",
      "This cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 1 to May 31, 2022, among medical staff who were on the frontline during the epidemic breakout in Shanghai from different institutions. The MBI-HSS was used to assess burnout, PHQ-9, GAD-7 and ISI were used to evaluate mental status and insomnia.\n",
      "A total of 543 valid questionnaires were collected. The depersonalization, depression, anxiety, and insomnia scores of medical staff were significantly higher during the pandemic in Shanghai compared with norms, while lack of personal achievement scores were decreased. Working time, work unit, work environment and age are important influencers of burnout, depression and anxiety of medical staff. Long working hours are the most likely causes of burnout and emotional disorders. Medical staff in primary hospitals were most likely to suffer from burnout and emotional disorders, while medical staff in tertiary hospitals had a reduced sense of personal achievement. Young medical staff are prone to negative emotions such as depression and anxiety, while older medical staff have a lower sense of personal accomplishment. Medical staff who were not in the shelter hospitals or designated hospitals were more likely to have problems of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and anxiety than those who were in the shelter hospitals or designated hospitals. Contracting COVID-19 had no effect on medical staff. Emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were positively correlated with anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders while personal achievement was negatively correlated with these factors.\n",
      "Medical staff in Shanghai had high burnout, depression, anxiety and insomnia levels during the epidemic outbreak in Shanghai. During the COVID-19, medical staff may suffer different psychological problems which should be concerned. Care and supports about burnout, mental health and insomnia need to be taken to promote the mental health of medical staff according to different characteristics of medical staff.\n",

      "We aimed to describe the variation in troponin I measurement and the cardiovascular diagnostic and therapeutic approach to elevated troponin I among critically ill adults with sepsis.\n",
      "Observational cohort study of the hospital-level variation in serial troponin I measurement, trending troponin I to peak, echocardiography, cardiac stress test, cardiac catheterization, antiplatelet agents, therapeutic anticoagulation, beta-blockers, and statins quantified using hospital median odds ratios-the median odds of receiving an intervention at randomly selected higher versus lower rate hospitals-derived from multivariable-adjusted random-effects logistic regression models with hospital site as the random effect. The Premier Healthcare Database was used. Patients were adults aged greater than 18 years admitted to the ICU with sepsis from 2016 to 2020.\n",
      "The hospital-level median odds ratios of troponin I measurement as well as cardiovascular diagnostics and therapeutics.\n",
      "Among 85,830 adults with sepsis, 53,058 (61.8%) had a troponin I measured, with a median odds ratio of troponin measurement across hospitals of 5.30 (95% CI, 4.98-5.67). Among 27,665 adults (32.2%) with sepsis and an elevated troponin I level, 84.8% had serial troponin I measurements, 66.0% had troponin trended to peak level, 66.7% had an echocardiogram, 4.1% had a cardiac stress test, 6.6% underwent cardiac catheterization, 48.3% received antiplatelet agents, 8.3% received therapeutic anticoagulation, 50.5% received beta-blockers, and 38.1% received statins. The median odds ratios between hospitals for cardiovascular diagnostics and therapeutics ranged from 1.28 (95% CI, 1.24-1.32) for use of beta-blockers to 7.58 (95% CI, 6.43-8.77) for use of therapeutic anticoagulation.\n",

      "Migraine is one of the most common diseases. Curcumin with anti-oxidative and anti-neuroinflammatory properties might have beneficial effects in migraine patients. This study will be conducted to evaluate the effects of a phytosomal preparation of curcumin on clinical signs, oxidative stress, and inflammatory parameters in patients with migraine.\n",
      "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in which, 60 patients with migraine will be assigned to receive a daily dose of 250 mg of phytosomal curcumin for 8 weeks (intervention group) or 250 mg maltodextrin as a placebo for the same duration (control group). Before and after the study, frequency, duration, and severity of the attacks, quality of life and sleep, mood status, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), Nitric Oxide (NO), and oxidative stress factors will be measured.\n",
      "It seems that phytosomal formulation of curcumin (a solid dispersion preparation of curcumin with phosphatidylserine) with high bioavailability, can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and result in decreased neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neurotoxicity. This way, phytosomal curcumin might lead to reduction of headaches and other complications of migraine and increase the quality of life of patients with migraine.\n",

      "A cross-sectional online survey, including EQ-5D-3L, Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and caregiver and patient characteristics questions, was developed to assess ATTRv caregiver burden. A companion general population survey collected EQ-5D-3L, HADS and chronic health conditions data. Caregiver-control group differences in HRQoL were assessed using t-tests and chi-square tests. Ordinary Least Squares regression was used to estimate the disutility of being a caregiver compared to controls stratified by patient ambulatory status.\n",

The disease severity of patients they cared for was varied: 33% required no assistance walking, 58% required assistance with walking and 9% required a wheelchair/were bedridden. On average, caregivers spent 6 h daily on practical care and 4 h daily on emotional support. Fifty-six percent indicated that they had changed their employment due to providing ATTRv care. Caregivers reported lower HRQoL, as indicated by lower EQ-5D 3L utility scores (M = 0.772, SD = 0.178 vs. M = 0.849, SD = 0.218) and higher HADS anxiety (9.3 vs. 6.1, p < 0.01) and depression (7.6 vs. 4.4, p < 0.01) scores, compared with matched controls. Caregivers were also more likely to report sleep problems (33% vs. 8%, p < 0.01) and stress (42% vs. 0%, p < 0.001) as chronic conditions than controls.\n",

Therefore, the aims of this study are to (1) understand the relationship between minority stress and sleep disturbance in a sample of sexual minority men, and (2) test whether these relationships are mediated by generalized anxiety symptoms and perception of stress.\n",
      "In 2020, 239 sexual minority men were recruited to complete an online survey. Participants responded to scales assessing minority stress (ie, internalized homophobia, experiences of harassment, microaggressions), perception of stress, generalized anxiety symptoms, and sleep disturbance. Linear regressions were used to test the relationship between minority stress and sleep disturbance and to test generalized anxiety symptoms and perception of stress as mediators.\n",
      "The final model was significant (F = 16.916, p < .001) and accounted for 43.5% of the variance in sleep disturbance. Generalized anxiety symptoms and perception of stress fully mediated the relationships between minority stress and sleep disturbance.\n",

The questionnaire included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, an Adverse Childhood Experiences questionnaire, the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), and measures of health conditions, and other sample demographics. Moderation analyses were used to examine the interaction between ACEs and five adaptive ER skills of CERQ on sleep quality in older adults, while accounting for the effects of age, sex, income, body mass index, and health.\n",

      "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disturbance in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with an emerging literature showing that treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy has a moderate effect on decreasing PTSD severity. Unfortunately, PAP adherence among individuals with PTSD is low. Our study examined how baseline PTSD cluster sub-scores predict 6-month PAP adherence and how PAP adherence predicts change in PTSD cluster sub-scores over time.\n",
      "We examined PTSD and PAP adherence in 41 Veterans with PTSD newly diagnosed with OSA over 6-months of PAP use (mean age=50.27 years; 73.7% Caucasian; 13.6% female). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Specific (PCL-S) was used to examine PTSD and subscales (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal). We used longitudinal analyses to examine PTSD sub-scores on PAP adherence, and PAP adherence predicting changes in PTSD sub-scores at 6-month follow-up.\n",
      "Among Veterans with PTSD, higher levels of reexperiencing and hyperarousal, but not avoidance, predicted lower PAP use. Overall, the high adherent group showed a 14.36 point decrease on the PCL-S while the low adherent group averaged just 3.66 point decrease. More days of PAP use was associated with greater improvement in hyperarousal and avoidance sub-scores, but not reexperiencing.\n",
      "Our findings reaffirm the importance of PAP use among patients with comorbid PTSD and sleep apnea, as well as the difficulty of achieving adherent PAP use in this population. Directly addressing heightened reexperiencing and hyperarousal in PTSD may increase PAP adherence among Veterans with PTSD and requires future research.\n",

      "A total of 415 pregnant women were recruited by using a systematic random sampling technique from 28 April 2020 to 12 June 2020.\n",
      "The desired data were collected through face-to-face interview technique by using validated questionnaires such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Oslo-3 and Abuse Assessment Screen. The data were analysed by using SPSS V.20. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify associated factors with poor sleep quality. Variables having a p value of less than 0.2 in the bivariate analysis were entered to the multivariable logistic regression. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant, at 95% CI.\n",
      "In this study, 175 (42.2%) pregnant women had poor sleep quality. According to multivariable logistic regression, being first and third trimesters of gestational age (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.61 and aOR 3.45, 95% CI 2.05 to 5.79, respectively), consumption of caffeinated substances (aOR 2.96, 95% CI 1.68 to 5.52), having depression (aOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.76), having high perceived stress (aOR 5.39, 95% CI 1.96 to 14.79) and experience of intimate partner violence (aOR 5.57, 95% CI 2.19 to 14.68) were positive significant associated factors with poor sleep quality.\n",
      "The prevalence of poor sleep quality among pregnant women was relatively high. First and third trimesters, consumption of caffeinated substances, antenatal depression, high perceived stress and intimate partner violence were factors significantly associated with poor sleep quality. This result suggests that all pregnant women should be screened and treated for poor sleep quality during the first and third trimesters.\n",

      "Shift work, which often results in sleep deprivation and circadian desynchrony, has been associated with increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed at studying the impact of sleep duration, circadian disruption and sleep quality on MS risk.\n",
      "We used a Swedish population-based case-control study (2075 cases, 3164 controls). Aspects of sleep were associated with MS risk by calculating OR with 95% CIs using logistic regression models.\n",
      "Compared with sleeping 7-9 hours/night during adolescence, short sleep (<7 hours/night) was associated with increased risk of developing MS (OR 1.4, 95% OR 1.1-1.7). Similarly, subjective low sleep quality during adolescence increased the risk of subsequently developing MS (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9), whereas phase shift did not significantly influence the risk. Our findings remained similar when those who worked shifts were excluded.\n",
      "Insufficient sleep and low sleep quality during adolescence seem to increase the risk of subsequently developing MS. Sufficient restorative sleep at young age, needed for adequate immune functioning, may be a preventive factor against MS.\n",

      "The effects of pre-sleep protein supplementation on endurance athletes remain unclear, particularly whether its potential benefits are due to the timing of protein intake or solely to an increased total protein intake. We assessed the effects of pre-sleep protein supplementation in professional cyclists during a training camp accounting for the influence of protein timing.\n",
      "Twenty-four professional U23 cyclists (19 ± 1 years, peak oxygen uptake: 79.8 ± 4.9 ml/kg/min) participated in a six-day training camp. Participants were randomized to consume a protein supplement (40 g of casein) before sleep (n = 8) or in the afternoon (n = 8), or an isoenergetic placebo (40 g of carbohydrates) before sleep (n = 8). Indicators of fatigue/recovery (Hooper index, Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes, countermovement jump), body composition, and performance (1-, 5-, and 20-minute time trials, as well as the estimated critical power) were assessed as study outcomes.\n",
      "The training camp resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) increase in training loads (\n",
      "Protein supplementation, whether administered before sleep or earlier in the day, exerts no beneficial effects during a short-term strenuous training period in professional cyclists, who naturally consume a high-protein diet.\n",

      "Tuberculosis (TB) patients commonly suffer from sleep issues owing to various adverse drug reactions (ADRs), disease symptoms, and the contagious nature of their disease. These sleep issues negatively affect the treatment outcome and quality of life. However, the prevalence of sleep disturbance and its associated factors among TB patients have rarely been reported.\n",
      "A total of 497 inpatients with TB from three hospitals in China were enrolled in this cross-sectional study to investigate their sleep quality using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). Clinical data, including demographic information, TB-related stigma, perceived stress, and nutrition- and immunity-related indicators, were also collected to explore the factors associated with sleep disturbance among the recruited patients.\n",
      "Approximately 70% of the recruited patients reported a sleep disturbance to varying degrees, presenting poorer global and subjective sleep qualities, longer sleep latency, shorter sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency, more frequent sleep disturbances, greater use of sleeping medication, and more severe daytime dysfunction. Furthermore, the body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin levels, albumin levels, and T lymphocyte count of the patients in the poor sleep quality group were significantly lower than those in the good sleep quality group (\n",
      "Three-quarters of the participants were found to suffer from a probable sleep disturbance. And sleep problems are linked to biological traits that interact with psychological, cultural, and social factors in complex ways. It is therefore important to pay attention to the sleep quality of TB patients, especially those with the identified risk factors. Besides, taking care of these risk factors may prove to be an effective sleep management strategy.\n",

      "Recent publications from several countries have reported that more young people (mainly girls) are experiencing precocious puberty (PP)/menarche during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic compared to the past. This variation is attributed to the stress of confinement, lack of exercise, obesity and disturbed sleep patterns. A common feature of the relevant papers, however, is the small number of reported cases of PP. Studies have shown that searches for diseases on the internet also reflect to some extent the epidemiology of these diseases.\n",
      "To estimate, through internet searches for PP, any changes in the epidemiology of PP.\n",
      "We assessed in Google Trends searches for 21 PP-related terms in English internationally (which practically dwarf searches in other languages), in the years 2017-2021. Additionally, we assessed local searches for selected terms, in English and local languages, in countries where a rise in PP has been reported. Searches were collected in Relative Search Volumes format and analyzed using Kendall's Tau test, with a statistical significance threshold of \n",
      "Internationally, searches for three PP-related terms showed no noticeable change over the study period, while searches for eight terms showed a decrease. An increase was found over time in searches for nine PP-related terms. Of the 17 searches in English and local languages, in countries where a rise in PP has been reported, 5 showed a significant increase over time.\n",
      "Over the study period, more than half of the search terms showed little change or declined. The discrepancy between internet searches for PP and the reported increase in the literature is striking. It would be expected that a true increase in the incidence of PP would also be aptly reflected in Google trends. If our findings are valid, the literature may have been biased. The known secular trend of decreasing age of puberty may also have played a role.\n",

      "This retrospective cohort study investigates how parenting stress, measured at 4 months of age by use of a classic three-dimensional parent-reported scale (Parenting Stress Index, 4th Ed. or PSI-4), can predict anxiety symptoms and quality of sleep at 24 months in toddlers with congenital heart disease (CHD).\n",
      "Sixty-six toddlers with CHD followed at our cardiac neurodevelopmental follow-up clinic were included in this study. As part of their systematic developmental assessment program, parents completed questionnaires on their stress level (PSI-4) when their child was 4 months old, and on their child's anxiety symptoms and quality of sleep at 24 months. Eight multiple linear regression models were built on the two measures collected at 24 months using the PSI-4 scores collected at 4 months. For each measure, four models were built from the PSI-4 total score and its three subscales (Parental Distress, Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction, Difficult Child), controlling for sex and socioeconomic status.\n",
      "The PSI-4 Difficult Child subscale, which focuses on parenting anxiety related to the child's behavioral problems and poor psychosocial adjustment, accounted for 17% of the child's anxiety symptoms at 24 months. The two other PSI-4 subscales (Parental Distress and Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction) and the PSI-4 total score did not contribute significantly to the models. None of the four regression models on perceived quality of sleep were significant. It is important to note that 33% of parents responded defensively to the PSI-4.\n",
      "Parenting stress related to the child's behavioral problems and poor psychosocial adjustment, measured when the child is 4 months old, is associated with the child's ulterior anxiety symptoms. As very few standardized tools are available to assess the behavioral and psychoaffective development of infants, this study highlights the importance of early psychosocial screening in parents of infants with CHD. The high rate of significant Defensive Responding Indices reminds us to not take parent reports at face value, as their actual stress levels might be higher.\n",

This review focuses on lifestyle guidance and counselling methods for general neurosurgeons to reduce risks of seizures in epilepsy patients, and to maximize patient independence. Reduction of seizure precipitants such as sleep deprivation, emotional stress, fatigue, and alcohol is key to epilepsy practice with appropriate anti-seizure medication. The modular service package epilepsy(MOSES)program may prove useful for patients by increasing awareness of their own seizure precipitants and empower them to manage their individual risks.

      "Damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules released from dead/dying cells following toxicant and/or environmental exposures that activate the immune response through binding of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Excessive production of DAMPs or failed clearance leads to chronic inflammation and delayed inflammation resolution. One category of DAMPs are oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs) produced upon exposure to high levels of oxidative stress, such as following ozone (O\n",

      "Examining Daily Associations Among Sleep, Stress, and Blood Pressure Across Adulthood.\n",
      "Sleep can have consequential effects on people's health and well-being, and these effects may vary among younger and older adults.\n",
      "The goal of the present study was to investigate how sleep relates to physiologic and stress responses in daily life across adulthood.\n",
      "We used an Ecological Momentary Assessment method in a large sample of participants (N = 4,359; Mage = 46.75, SD = 12.39; 69.30% male, 29.85% female) who completed morning sleep diaries, reported subjective stress, and recorded their heart rate and blood pressure for 21 days. Sleep was assessed with self-reports of duration, efficiency, and quality.\n",
      "Using multilevel modeling, between-person analyses showed that sleep duration, efficiency, and quality were negatively related to morning heart rate and stress, such that people who slept longer, more efficiently, or better experienced lower heart rate and stress compared to those who slept shorter, less efficiently, or worse. Within-person analyses showed that sleep duration, efficiency, and quality predicted morning heart rate, blood pressure (though less consistently), and stress. That is, people experienced lower heart, blood pressure, and stress following nights when they slept longer, more efficiently, or better than they typically did. These within-person relationships were moderated by age, such that the effects of better and longer sleep on lower morning heart rate, blood pressure, and stress were stronger among younger than older adults.\n",
      "These findings suggest that daily variations in sleep show immediate associations with stress and physiologic responses, but these daily variations have a stronger relationship among younger compared to older adults.\n",
      "We examined how sleep influences people’s blood pressure and well-being among younger and older adults. Participants (N = 4,359) completed questionnaires in the morning over the course of 21 days and reported how well and how long they slept that night and how stressed they felt. They also recorded their heart rate and blood pressure using an optic sensor on their phones. Our analyses showed that people who slept longer, more efficiently, or better experienced lower levels of heart rate and stress on average compared to those who slept shorter, less efficiently, or worse. In addition, we examined how changes in sleep influenced stress, heart rate, and blood pressure for a given individual. These analyses showed that people experienced lower heart rate, lower blood pressure, and less stress following nights when they slept longer, more efficiently, or better than they typically did. These relationships varied by age such that the beneficial effects of sleep were more pronounced among younger than older adults. That is, receiving a particularly good night of sleep tends to be beneficial for younger adults, whereas older adults may not be influenced as strongly by the quality and duration of their sleep.\n",

      "Age Influences on Lifestyle and Stress Perception in the Working Population.\n",
      "Workplace health promotion programs and services offered by insurers may play a fundamental role to foster health/well-being and to prevent chronic diseases. To this end, they should be tailored to companies/employees’ requirements and characteristics. In particular, age needs to be taken into account, considering both that young age workers are generally healthy, and that young age is the best period in lifespan to address prevention and instilling healthy behaviors. We employed an anonymous, simple web-based questionnaire (filled out by 1305 employees) which furnishes data regarding lifestyle (nutrition, exercise, smoking, stress, sleep, etc.), some of which were used to build a unique descriptor (Lifestyle Index; 0−100 higher scores being healthier). We considered three subgroups accordingly to age: ≤30; between 30 and 50; >50 years. This study showed age influences lifestyle and stress perception in the working population: the youngest employees (both men and women) presented the worst lifestyle index, particularly in its stress component. This observation may potentially be useful to tailor workplace health promotion programs and to personalize insurance protocols and services offered to employees. The practical message of our study is that in healthy young people focusing only on medical parameters (frequently within normal ranges in this cohort), albeit important, may be not sufficient to foster proactive actions to prevent chronic non-communicable diseases in adult life. Vice versa, driving their attention on current behaviors might elicit their proactive role to improve lifestyle, getting immediate advantages such as well-being improvement and the possibility to best manage stress.\n",

      "Circular Dichroism Study of Orexin B under Oxidative Stress Conditions.\n",
      "The neuropeptides orexin A and B regulate various vital functions of the body, such as sleep/wake states, metabolism, and energy homeostasis. A loss of their physiological activity, with reduced ability to recognize their receptors, is suspected to be associated with oxidative stress conditions. These are related to excessive presence of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, as well as of reactive lipoxidation byproducts. With the aim of evaluating the effects of oxidative stress on the secondary structure of orexin peptides, orexin B was synthesized and characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy under different conditions. In aqueous solution it presents an unordered conformation, while in a membrane mimetic environment it assumes a helical structure. The effects of oxidative stress were evaluated exposing it to both oxygen and nitrogen radicals as well as to lipoxidation byproducts. The results showed that ROS, but not NRS, induced appreciable conformational changes, and only in the membrane mimetic environment. Lipoxidation byproducts, instead, led to secondary structure modifications much more evident than those induced by the direct action of ROS and RNS, and in both analyzed media. Additionally, MALDI-TOF analyses detected mass variations in the peptide attributable to oxidation of the C-terminal Met residue and deamination of asparagine in the Asn-His sequence. Taken together, all these data seem to confirm the involvement of oxidative processes in dysfunctions of the orexinergic system.\n",

      "Melatonin from Microorganisms, Algae, and Plants as Possible Alternatives to Synthetic Melatonin.\n",
      "Melatonin dietary supplements are widely consumed worldwide, with developed countries as the largest consumers, with an estimated annual growth rate of approximately 10% until 2027, mainly in developing countries. The wide use of melatonin against sleep disorders and particular problems, such as jet lag, has been added to other applications, such as anti-aging, anti-stress, immune system activation, anticancer, and others, which have triggered its use, normally without a prescription. The chemical industry currently covers 100% of the needs of the melatonin market. Motivated by sectors with more natural consumption habits, a few years ago, the possibility of obtaining melatonin from plants, called phytomelatonin, arose. More recently, the pharmaceutical industry has developed genetically modified microorganisms whose ability to produce biological melatonin in bioreactors has been enhanced. This paper reviews the aspects of the chemical and biological synthesis of melatonin for human consumption, mainly as dietary supplements. The pros and cons of obtaining melatonin from microorganisms and phytomelatonin from plants and algae are analyzed, as well as the advantages of natural melatonin, avoiding unwanted chemical by-products from the chemical synthesis of melatonin. Finally, the economic and quality aspects of these new products, some of which are already marketed, are analyzed.\n",

      "Evaluation of Blood Levels of Omentin-1 and Orexin-A in Adults with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\n",
      "Background and objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can be related to changes in the levels of adipokines and neuropeptides, which in turn may affect the energy balance components of neuronal cells. Herein, a systematic review and meta-analysis checked the changes in serum/plasma levels of omentin-1 (OM-1: an adipokine) and orexin-A (OXA: a neuropeptide) in adults (age > 18 years old) with OSA (aOSA) compared to controls. Materials and methods: Four databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) were systematically searched until 14 November 2022, without any restrictions. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist adapted for case−control studies was used to assess the quality of the papers. The effect sizes were extracted using the Review Manager 5.3 software for the blood levels of OM-1 and OXA in aOSA compared with controls. Results: Thirteen articles, with six studies for OM-1 levels and eight for OXA levels, were included. The pooled standardized mean differences were −0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI): −2.19, 0.48; p = 0.21; I2 = 98%) and −0.20 (95%CI: −1.16, 0.76; p = 0.68; I2 = 96%) for OM-1 and OXA levels, respectively. Among the studies reporting OM-1, five were high and one was moderate quality. Among the studies reporting OXA, six were moderate, one was high, and one was low quality. Based on the trial sequential analysis, more participants are needed to confirm the pooled results of the analyses of blood levels of OM-1 and OXA. In addition, the radial plot showed outliers as significant factors for high heterogeneity. Conclusions: The main findings indicated a lack of association between the blood levels of OM-1 and OXA and OSA risk. Therefore, OM-1 and OXA did not appear to be suitable biomarkers for the diagnosis and development of OSA.\n",

      "The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Postpartum Maternal Mental Health.\n",
      "There are reports of mental health worsening during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to assess whether this occurred in women who were pregnant at baseline (late 2019) and unaware of the pandemic, and who delivered after the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions and threat (March-April 2020). To compare the pandemic period with the pre-pandemic, we capitalized on a retrospective 2014-2015 perinatal sample which had had affective symptoms assessed.\n",
      "The COVID sample were administered the Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Hypomania Checklist-32 (HCL-32), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) at T0 (pregnancy) and T1 (post-delivery). The Non-COVID sample had completed EPDS and HCL-32 at the same timepoints.\n",
      "The COVID sample included 72 women, aged 21-46 years (mean = 33.25 years ± 4.69), and the Non-COVID sample included 68 perinatal women, aged 21-46 years (mean = 34.01 years ± 4.68). Our study showed greater levels of mild depression in T1 among the COVID sample compared to the Non-COVID sample. No significant differences in terms of major depression and suicidal ideation were found. The levels of hypomania were significantly different between the two groups at T1, with the COVID sample scoring higher than the Non-COVID sample. This may be related to the high levels of perceived stress we found during the postpartum evaluation in the COVID sample.\n",
      "There was a relatively small sample size.\n",
      "New mothers responded to the pandemic with less mental health impairment than expected, differently from the general population. Women delivering amidst the pandemic did not differ in depressive and anxiety symptoms from their pre-pandemic scores and from pre-pandemic women. Because stress responses have high energy costs, it is optimal for maternal animals to minimize such high metabolic costs during motherhood. Evidence suggests that reproductive experience alters the female brain in adaptive ways. This maternal brain plasticity facilitates a higher purpose, the continuation of the species. This may point to the recruitment of motherhood-related resources, for potentially overcoming the effects of the pandemic on mental health.\n",

      "Resilience, Stress, Well-Being, and Sleep Quality in Multiple Sclerosis.\n",
      "(1) Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive, immune-mediated disorder that affects the Central Nervous System and is the most common cause of non-traumatic neurological disability in young adults. The study aimed to assess the levels of stress, resilience, well-being, sleep quality, and fatigue in Israeli people with MS (PwMS), and to examine the associations between these factors and the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. These factors had never before been studied in conjunction in PwMS, nor had they been systematically addressed in Israel, the unique geopolitical situation of which may pose unique challenges. (2) Methods: This was a survey-based, cross-sectional study conducted through an Internet platform. (3) Results: Israeli PwMS who participated in the study were experiencing relatively high levels of stress and low resilience, poor sleep quality, and severe fatigue. The analysis revealed significant associations between resilience and stress, well-being, and anxiety, as well as stress and well-being, resilience, sleep quality, fatigue, and Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS). (4) Conclusions: the Israeli PwMS who participated in the study were experiencing higher levels of stress, lower resilience and worse sleep quality than PwMS in other countries, as compared to results previously reported in literature. The findings of this study ought to serve as a call to action for the MS care providers in Israel and warrant further research into the possible causes of the phenomenon and strategies to address it.\n",

      "Sleep Deprivation Increases Facial Skin Yellowness.\n",
      "Sleep shortage is a major concern in modern life and induces various psycho-physical disorders, including skin problems. In cosmeceutics, females are aware that sleep deprivation worsens their facial skin tone. Here, we measured the effects of sleep deprivation on facial skin yellowness and examined yellow chromophores, such as bilirubin and carotenoids, in blood serum as potential causes of yellowness. Total sleep deprivation (0 h sleep overnight, N = 28) and repeated partial sleep deprivation (4 h sleep for 5 consecutive days, N = 10) induced significant increases in facial skin yellowness. The higher yellowness was sustained even after both sleep deprivation types stopped. However, circulating levels of yellow chromophores were unchanged in the total sleep deprivation study. Neither circulating interleukin-6 nor urinary biopyrrin levels were affected by total sleep deprivation, suggesting that apparent oxidative stress in the body was not detected in the present total deprivation protocol. Facial redness was affected by neither total nor repeated partial sleep deprivation. Therefore, blood circulation may play a limited role in elevated yellowness. In conclusion, facial skin yellowness was indeed increased by sleep deprivation in our clinical studies. Local in situ skin-derived factors, rather than systemic chromophore change, may contribute to the sleep deprivation-induced elevation of facial skin yellowness.\n",

      "Rationale for a Multi-Factorial Approach for the Reversal of Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's Disease and MCI: A Review.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial, progressive, neurodegenerative disease typically characterized by memory loss, personality changes, and a decline in overall cognitive function. Usually manifesting in individuals over the age of 60, this is the most prevalent type of dementia and remains the fifth leading cause of death among Americans aged 65 and older. While the development of effective treatment and prevention for AD is a major healthcare goal, unfortunately, therapeutic approaches to date have yet to find a treatment plan that produces long-term cognitive improvement. Drugs that may be able to slow down the progression rate of AD are being introduced to the market; however, there has been no previous solution for preventing or reversing the disease-associated cognitive decline. Recent studies have identified several factors that contribute to the progression and severity of the disease: diet, lifestyle, stress, sleep, nutrient deficiencies, mental health, socialization, and toxins. Thus, increasing evidence supports dietary and other lifestyle changes as potentially effective ways to prevent, slow, or reverse AD progression. Studies also have demonstrated that a personalized, multi-therapeutic approach is needed to improve metabolic abnormalities and AD-associated cognitive decline. These studies suggest the effects of abnormalities, such as insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, hypovitaminosis D, hormonal deficiencies, and hyperhomocysteinemia, in the AD process. Therefore a personalized, multi-therapeutic program based on an individual's genetics and biochemistry may be preferable over a single-drug/mono-therapeutic approach. This article reviews these multi-therapeutic strategies that identify and attenuate all the risk factors specific to each affected individual. This article systematically reviews studies that have incorporated multiple strategies that target numerous factors simultaneously to reverse or treat cognitive decline. We included high-quality clinical trials and observational studies that focused on the cognitive effects of programs comprising lifestyle, physical, and mental activity, as well as nutritional aspects. Articles from PubMed Central, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were collected, and abstracts were reviewed for relevance to the subject matter. Epidemiological, pathological, toxicological, genetic, and biochemical studies have all concluded that AD represents a complex network insufficiency. The research studies explored in this manuscript confirm the need for a multifactorial approach to target the various risk factors of AD. A single-drug approach may delay the progression of memory loss but, to date, has not prevented or reversed it. Diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, and environment all contribute to the progression of the disease, and, therefore, a multi-factorial optimization of network support and function offers a rational therapeutic strategy. Thus, a multi-therapeutic program that simultaneously targets multiple factors underlying the AD network may be more effective than a mono-therapeutic approach.\n",

      "Factors Associated with Insomnia and Aggression among Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 Pandemic.\n",
      "(1) Healthcare workers are exposed to increased risks of insomnia and aggression during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to assess insomnia, sleep disturbances, and aggression and identify the associated risk factors among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) A total of 264 healthcare workers participated in the study. The study was conducted with the diagnostic survey method, using the Buss−Perry Aggression Questionnaire, the Athens Insomnia Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and a self-administered questionnaire. (3) The vast majority of the respondents (81.06%) suffered from insomnia and had poor sleep quality (78.03%). Education (p = 0.038), marital status (p = 0.043), and working with patients suffering from COVID-19 (p = 0.024) were statistically significant contributors to insomnia. Age was found to significantly correlate with total aggression (r = −0.133 p = 0.031), verbal aggression (r = −0.138 p = 0.025), and anger (r = −0.151 p = 0.014). The analysis demonstrated statistically significant relationships between gender and physical aggression (p = 0.017), anger (p = 0.032), and hostility (p = 0.002). A statistically significant positive correlation between the quality of sleep as per the PSQI and all subscales of the BPAQ was found (p < 0.001). (4) A considerable proportion of HCWs experienced sleep disturbances during the outbreak, stressing the need to establish ways to reduce long-term adverse outcomes associated with chronic insomnia and mental health problems and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions.\n",

      "Healthcare Workers after Two Years of COVID-19: The Consequences of the Pandemic on Psychological Health and Sleep among Nurses and Physicians.\n",
      "COVID-19 has challenged the health workforce worldwide. In this cross-sectional study with a retrospective assessment, we explored the impact of the pandemic on mental health and sleep among a sample of Italian nurses and medical doctors. A total of 287 healthcare workers (212 nurses and 75 physicians) completed a web survey on socio-demographic, psychological, and sleep-related aspects referring to the period before the pandemic and to the present period of February to June 2022. Comparisons between nurses and physicians revealed that the former had greater distress in response to the pandemic. Consistently, the multivariate analysis of covariance showed that even if both groups were negatively impacted by the pandemic, nurses presented a greater worsening over time regarding several psychological and sleep symptoms. Furthermore, we observed that working on the frontline represented an additional risk factor for nurses. In line with previous evidence, we also found that personal experiences with COVID-19 are significant predictors of the current health status. Our results underscore the urgent need for preventive programs among healthcare operators to increase their coping skills and prevent the long-term consequences of chronic stress, especially for high-risk professionals. Specific attention should also be devoted to programs to improve sleep quality and reduce sleep-related traumatic symptoms.\n",

      "Positive Impacts of a Four-Week Neuro-Meditation Program on Cognitive Function in Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\n",
      "Study objective: Long COVID patients can experience high levels of impairment in their cognitive function and mental health. Using a parallel randomized control trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of a neuro-meditation program to reduce cognitive impairment in patients with long COVID. Methods: A total of 34 patients with long COVID were randomized to an intervention group (G-Int; n = 17) or a control group (G-Con; n = 17) and 15 healthy participants were constitutive of a normative group (G-Nor). The intervention consisted of ten 30-min sessions of Rebalance® over a period of five weeks. Each session included sound therapy and coach-guided meditation associated with light stimulations (i.e., chromotherapy). Primary outcomes were performance on five computerized cognitive tasks (choice response time, pattern comparison, Simon, pursuit rotor task, and Corsi block-tapping task), mental and physical fatigue (Chalder fatigue scale), perceived stress (perceived stress scale) and mood (profiles of mood states). Secondary outcomes were anxiety and depressive symptoms (hospital anxiety and depression scale), muscular pain, joint pain, and headaches using visual analog scales (VAS) as well as sleep quality (Spiegel sleep questionnaire). Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 1−2 and 7−8 days of follow-up. Results: Compared to healthy subjects, long COVID patients showed significant differences at baseline on all the self-report questionnaires, and a Rebalance® program improved all the subjective reports, as well as cognitive performances, especially on reaction time-based tasks. In particular, only the G-Int group revealed shortened reaction times in the choice reaction time (RTbaseline = 593 ± 121 ms vs. RTpost2 = 521 ± 86 ms, p < 0.001), Simon (RTbaseline = 539 ± 123 ms vs. RTpost2 = 494 ± 134 ms, p < 0.01), and pattern comparison tasks (RTbaseline = 1244 ± 315 ms vs. RTpost2 = 1079 ± 213 ms, p < 0.001). Conclusions) Initial evidence suggests that neuro-meditation reduces cognitive impairment and improves physical and mental fatigue, muscle and joint pain, symptoms of depression and anxiety, mood disturbances as well as sleep quality. The Rebalance® program hence constitutes a promising non-pharmacological intervention for the treatment of long-term psychological/cognitive outcomes of COVID-19.\n",

      "Causal Model Analysis of the Effect of Formalism, Fear of Infection, COVID-19 Stress on Firefighters' Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome and Insomnia.\n",
      "As the front line of epidemic prevention, firefighters are responsible for the transportation of infected cases. Firefighters are under a lot of stress from the new COVID-19, especially the fear that they may contract the virus at work and spread the virus to their families. In particular, the framework of this study incorporates Riggs' formalism variables. When firefighters think that the epidemic prevention regulations are inconsistent with the actual epidemic prevention, it will increase their work pressure on COVID-19. In this study, firefighters from all over Taiwan were used as the respondents, and a total of 453 respondents were obtained. This study uses confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling to test the established hypotheses. The findings confirm that formalism, fear of self and family infection are positively influencing COVID-19 stress. COVID-19 stress positively affects PTSD and insomnia. COVID-19 stress negatively affects problem-focused strategies. Problem-focused strategies negatively affect post-traumatic stress disorder.\n",

      "Effectiveness Evaluation of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy Combined with Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for People with Post-Stroke Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\n",
      "Background: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is most prevalent during the rehabilitative period following a stroke. Recent studies verified the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy (rTMS) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in patients with depression. However, the effectiveness and prospect of application in PSD patients remain unclear. This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined intervention based on rTMS and MBSR for the physical and mental state of PSD patients. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study design was employed. Participants were recruited from the Rehabilitation Medicine Centre and randomly assigned to receive either MBSR combined with active or sham rTMS or sham rTMS combined with general psychological care. We used a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), a mini-mental state examination (MMSE), the Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to evaluate depressed symptoms, cognitive function, activities of daily living (ADL), and sleep quality at baseline, post-intervention, and the 8-week follow-up. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to compare differences between groups, and Pearson’s linear correlation was used to analyze the possible relationship between variables and potential predictors of depression improvement. Results: Seventy-two participants were randomized to rTMS−MBSR (n = 24), sham rTMS−MBSR (n = 24), or sham rTMS−general psychological care (n = 24). A total of 71 patients completed the questionnaire, a 99% response rate. There were significant time and group interaction effects in HAMD-17, MMSE, MBI, and PSQI scores (p < 0.001). The repeated-measure ANOVA showed a significant improvement of all variables in rTMS−MBSR compared to sham rTMS−MBSR and sham rTMS combined with general psychological care (p < 0.05). Additional results demonstrated that cognitive function, sleep quality, and activities of daily living are associated with depressive symptoms, and cognitive function is a potential variable for improved depression. Conclusion: Depressive symptoms can be identified early by assessing cognitive function, and rTMS−MBSR might be considered a potentially helpful treatment for PSD.\n",

      "The Effect of Earthing Mat on Stress-Induced Anxiety-like Behavior and Neuroendocrine Changes in the Rat.\n",
      "Grounding is a therapeutic technique that involves doing activities that “ground” or electrically reconnect us to the earth. The physiological effects of grounding have been reported from a variety of perspectives such as sleep or pain. However, its anti-stress efficacy is relatively unknown. The present study investigated the stress-related behavioral effects of earthing mat and its neurohormonal mechanisms in the Sprague−Dawley male rat. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: the naïve normal (Normal), the 21 days immobilization stressed (Control), the 21 days stressed + earthing mat for 7 days (A7) or 21 days (A21) group. The depressive-and anxiety like behaviors were measured by forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and elevated plus maze (EPM). Using immunohistochemistry, the expression of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) and c-Fos immunoreactivity were analyzed in the brain. In the EPM, time spent in the open arm of the earthing mat groups was significantly increased compared to the Control group (p < 0.001), even though there were without effects among groups in the FST and TST. The expression of CRF immunoreactive neurons in the earthing mat group was markedly decreased compared to the Control group. Overall, the earthing mat reduced stress-induced behavioral changes and expression of c-Fos and CRF immunoreactivity in the brain. These results suggest that the earthing mat may have the potential to improve stress-related responses via the regulation of the corticotrophinergic system.\n",

      "Actigraphic Wake after Sleep Onset and Symptom Severity Correspond with Rumination in Trauma-Exposed Individuals.\n",
      "Rumination and worry are forms of repetitive negative thinking (RNT) commonly associated with internalizing psychopathologies, although less is known about RNT in trauma-exposed individuals with internalizing psychopathologies. Separate lines of research show RNT also plays a role in problematic sleep, which is frequently experienced after trauma exposure. To address gaps in the literature, the current study examines the impact of sleep and symptoms on RNT in trauma-exposed participants. A transdiagnostic sample of 46 unmedicated treatment-seeking trauma-exposed participants completed standard measures of rumination and worry, as well as clinical measures that assessed posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety severity. Actigraphic sleep variables were sleep duration, wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency. Sleep and clinical measures were submitted to multiple regression analyses with rumination and worry as dependent variables. The regression results showed that rumination was significantly explained by WASO and posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) severity, and the omnibus test was significant. Depression, anxiety, and other estimates of sleep were not significant. No significant results emerged for worry. Preliminary findings suggest that PTSS and WASO, an index of fragmented sleep, may contribute to rumination, but not worry, in trauma-exposed individuals. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine potential causal relationships.\n",

      "Potential Role of Oxidative Stress in the Production of Volatile Organic Compounds in Obesity.\n",
      "Obesity is associated with numerous health issues such as sleep disorders, asthma, hepatic dysfunction, cancer, renal dysfunction, diabetes, cardiovascular complications, and infertility. Previous research has shown that the distribution of excess body fat, rather than excess body weight, determines obesity-related risk factors. It is widely accepted that abdominal fat is a serious risk factor for illnesses associated with obesity and the accumulation of visceral fat promotes the release of pro-oxidants, pro-inflammatory, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The metabolic process in the human body produces several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via urine, saliva, breath, blood, skin secretions, milk, and feces. Several studies have shown that VOCs are released by the interaction of ROS with underlying cellular components leading to increased protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, or DNA damage. These VOCs released via oxidative stress in obese individuals may serves as a biomarker for obesity-related metabolic alterations and disease. In this review, we focus on the relationship between oxidative stress and VOCs in obesity.\n",

Stressful life events play a role in the pathogenesis of sleep disorders such as insomnia which is considered a risk factor for anxiety and depression. Emotion regulation is an important factor linked with sleep and mental health problems. Therefore, the main goal of the present study was to examine whether insomnia could constitute a mediation mechanism that explains the relationship between emotion regulation strategies (rumination, reappraisal, suppression) and stress-induced mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

We should not only focus on the traditional risk factors, but also consider the impact of the risk factors on vascular health which have not received enough attention nor identified in the past, such as Beijing vascular health stratification (BVHS), sleep disturbance, dental diseases, mental stress, erectile dysfunction and inappropriate exercise. This consensus will provide suggestions for the examination, evaluation and management of non-traditional vascular health risk factors, provide references for doctors to make decisions, and standardize non-traditional risk factors and diagnosis and treatment. Further attention to non-traditional vascular health risk factors will provide new ideas and broaden new horizons for the prevention and control of vascular related diseases and the lifelong maintenance of vascular health.\n",

      "The COVID-19 global pandemic initiated an unprecedented medico-psychological turmoil. Our study investigates the psychological impact of the viral spread and austere lockdown, and focuses mostly on potential protective factors in a politically and economically unstable society.\n",
      "A cross-sectional design was used to evaluate rates of mental distress in a sample of 348 Lebanese adults. Participants filled questionnaires of perceived stress (PSS), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), PTSD (IES-22), as well as sleep (PSQi) and gratitude (GQ-6) immediately after 3 months of strict quarantine. Demographics included gender, age, employment and infection statuses. Correlations and regression models were used.\n",
      "Results indicated a very high prevalence of mental distress, in addition to major alterations in sleep quality and quantity. Younger age and unemployment correlated with more severe symptoms. Sleep was found to be a protective factor against all studied psychological distress, and gratitude further mitigated effects of depression.\n",
      "Mental health significantly degrades post-COVID lockdown, even in the absence of direct viral threat. Yet simple behavioral and cognitive changes like sleep and attitude of gratitude could provide protective factors against these psychological distresses. Such changes should be further explored and advocated as cost-efficient self-care practices to buffer this devastating public health burden, especially in unstable socio-political environments.\n",

      "Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy often have concomitant pulmonary hypertension, which has a negative prognostic effect in patients undergoing myectomy. Our objective was to investigate the effect of myectomy on pulmonary artery pressure obtained via Swan-Ganz catheter and characterize how changes in pulmonary artery systolic pressure may indicate outcomes in these patients.\n",
      "We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of 271 patients with recordings of intraoperative pulmonary artery pressures during surgical myectomy. We analyzed primary composite outcomes as 30-day or in-hospital major cardiopulmonary adverse events.\n",
      "There was a 5.17% adverse event rate. Patients with adverse events were older, were more likely to be female, had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and had longer cardiopulmonary bypass times. Some 35.7% of those with adverse events had moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure ≥50 mm Hg) on postbypass stress test, compared with 4.3% of those without adverse events (P < .001). Further, 21.4% of patients with adverse events had pulmonary artery systolic pressure 50 mm Hg or greater at the end of surgery, compared with 1.9% of patients without adverse events (P < .001). The pulmonary artery systolic pressure decrease after surgery in those without adverse events was on average 5 mm Hg more than in those with adverse events.\n",
      "Postoperative pulmonary hypertension was associated with a higher rate of adverse cardiopulmonary events. This may influence the decision to use Swan-Ganz catheters in patients undergoing septal myectomy in monitoring pulmonary artery pressures to better risk stratify and manage these patients postoperatively.\n",

      "Putting the pieces together to understand anger in combat veterans and service members: Psychological and physical contributors.\n",
      "Dysregulated anger can result in devastating health and interpersonal consequences for individuals, families, and communities. Compared to civilians, combat veterans and service members (C-V/SM) report higher levels of anger and often have risk factors for anger including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), pain, alcohol use, and impaired sleep. The current study examined the relative contributions of established variables associated with anger (e.g., combat exposure, current PTSD symptoms, history of TBI, pain interference, and hazardous alcohol use) in 1263 C-V/SM. Sleep impairments, represented by poor sleep quality and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) risk, were also evaluated as potential mediators of the relationships between established risk factors and anger, and therefore potential modifiable treatment targets. Multiple regression model results revealed that PTSD symptoms (β = 0.517, p < .001), OSA risk (β = 0.057, p = .016), pain interference (β = 0.214, p < .001), and hazardous alcohol use (β = 0.054, p = .009) were significantly associated with anger. Results of the mediation models revealed that OSA risk accounted for the association between PTSD and anger, in addition to the association between pain interference and anger. The current study extends previous literature by simultaneously examining factors associated with anger using a multivariable model in a large sample of C-V/SM. Additionally, treating OSA may be a novel way to reduce anger in C-V/SM who have PTSD and/or pain interference.\n",

Inconsistencies may be due to depression biological and clinical heterogeneity. Immuno-Metabolic Depression (IMD) has been put forward as a form of depression characterized by the clustering of low-grade inflammation, metabolic dysregulations and atypical, energy-related symptoms (overeating, weight gain, hypersomnia, fatigue and leaden paralysis). IMD features are present in ∼30% of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). By selecting these specific patients, directly targeting inflammation may reduce depressive symptoms.\n",

      "Effect of selective sleep deprivation on heart rate variability in post-90s healthy volunteers.\n",
      "The 5-minute frequency domain method was used to examine the effects of polysomnography (PSG)-guided acute selective sleep deprivation (REM/SWS) on the cardiovascular autonomic nervous system, heart rate, and rhythm in healthy volunteers to understand the relationship between cardiac neuro regulatory homeostasis and cardiovascular system diseases in healthy subjects. The study included 30 healthy volunteers selected through the randomized-controlled method, randomly divided into REM sleep deprivation and SWS sleep deprivation groups. PSG analyses and dynamic electrocardiogram monitoring were done at night, during slow wave sleep or REM sleep. An all-night sleep paradigm, without any interruptions, was tested 3 times for comparison. The frequency domain parameter method was further used to monitor the volunteers 5 min before and after a period of sleep deprivation. According to the characteristics of the all-night sleep scatter plot, healthy volunteers were divided into abnormal and normal scatter plot groups. When compared with the period before sleep deprivation, high frequency (HF) and normalized high-frequency component (HFnu) were found to be decreased. Normalized low-frequency component (LFnu) increased in the abnormal scatter plot group after sleep deprivation, and this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The scatter plot also showed that very low frequency (VLF) increased only in the normal group after deprivation and this difference, as well, was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The increase in diastolic blood pressure in the abnormal group was statistically significant (P < 0.05), but the change in blood pressure in the normal group was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). There are 62.5% of the patients and 20% of the employees that were observed to have abnormal whole-night sleep patterns during the uninterrupted whole-night sleep regime. Patients with atrial or ventricular premature beats (more than 0.1%), and those with ST-t changes during sleep, were all ascertained as abnormal. We concluded that some healthy people could face unstable autonomic nervous functioning related to their long-term tension, anxiety, time urgency, hostility, and other chronic stress states. In the face of acute sleep deprivation selectivity, mild stress based excitability of the vagus nerve is reduced, which diminishes the protective function, making them susceptible to conditions such as premature ventricular arrhythmia.\n",

Few studies have examined how these stressors were related to psychological distress among youth and young adults. This study assessed how psychological distress is associated with stress from social unrest, financial circumstances, and the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether poor sleep quality may explain these associations.\n",
      "Participants of a representative phone survey included 1,501 Hong Kong youth and young adults (Mage = 26.1 (4.0); 48.2% female). We examined the associations between psychological distress and three types of stress (social unrest, financial, and COVID-19 stress), and the indirect effect of poor sleep.\n",
      "Eleven point nine percent, 4.1%, and 9.7% of respondents reported feeling very seriously distressed by social unrest, financial circumstances, and the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. All three forms of stress were associated with poor sleep. The indirect effects of poor sleep on the association between all three forms of stress and psychological distress were identified.

      "Patients with OSA and healthy controls were assessed for clinical features, echocardiography, polysomnography, and blood biochemical data. Patients with OSA were divided into four groups: normal geometry (NG), concentric remodeling (CR), eccentric hypertrophy (EH), and concentric hypertrophy (CH). Correlations of SUA with left ventricular (LV) structure and function were examined through Pearson correlation analysis. The risk variables of LVG were investigated using a multivariate logistic regression model.\n",
      "Compared to controls, patients with OSA had greater SUA levels. The eccentric hypertrophy (EH) and concentric hypertrophy (CH) groups showed substantially greater SUA levels than the normal geometry (NG) and concentric remodeling (CR) groups (p < 0.05). SUA correlated positively with left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and relative wall thickness (RWT) but negatively with the E/A ratio, according to the Pearson correlation analysis. SUA independently affected EH (OR = 1.021, 95%CI = 1.015-1.028, p < 0.001) and CH (OR = 1.034, 95%CI = 1.025-1.043, p < 0.001) in patients with OSA by the multivariate logistic regression model.\n",

      "As a circadian rhythm hormone, melatonin is widely present in the body and has rich physiological functions. Compared to its prominent circadian role, melatonin has been extensively studied in many fields as an ancient antioxidant. In addition to being considered a potent antioxidant, melatonin has also been found to play an important role in mitochondrial homeostasis. Mitochondrial oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, the possible therapeutic value of melatonin as an antioxidant targeting mitochondria in atherosclerosis is worth exploring. The most widespread clinical applications of melatonin are in circadian rhythms and sleep, but the cardiovascular system may be the most promising area.\n",

      "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, recurrent mental disorder and a leading cause of disability worldwide. A large part of adult MDD patients report a history of childhood trauma (CT). Patients with MDD and CT are assumed to represent a clinically and neurobiologically distinct MDD subtype with an earlier onset, unfavorable disease course, stress systems' dysregulations and brain alterations. Currently, there is no evidence-based treatment strategy for MDD that specifically targets CT. Given the central role of trauma in MDD patients with CT, trauma-focused therapy (TFT), adjunctive to treatment as usual (TAU), may be efficacious to alleviate depressive symptoms in this patient population.\n",
      "The RESET-psychotherapy study is a 12-week, single-blind, randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of TFT in 158 adults with moderate to severe MDD, as a 'stand-alone' depression diagnosis or superimposed on a persistent depressive disorder (PDD), and CT. TFT (6-10 sessions of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing and/or imagery rescripting) + TAU is compared to TAU only. Assessments, including a wide range of psychological/psychiatric and biological characteristics, take place before randomization (T0), during treatment (T1), at post-treatment (T2) and at 6-month follow-up (T3). Pre-post treatment stress-related biomarkers in hair (cortisol) and blood (epigenetics and inflammation) will be assessed to better understand working mechanisms of TFT. A subgroup of 60 participants will undergo structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assessments to determine pre-post treatment brain activity. The primary outcome is self-reported depression symptom severity at post-treatment, measured with the 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (IDS-SR).\n",

      "The emergence of COVID-19 brought unparalleled changes in people's lifestyle, including sleep. We aimed to assess the bidirectional association between sleep quality and mental health and describe how sleep and mental health were affected in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic (between June 2020 and September 2021). Data were obtained from the Omtanke2020 study. Participants who completed the baseline survey and each of the 8 monthly follow-up surveys were included (N = 9035). We described the distribution of sleep and mental health in the different Swedish regions using maps and over the study period with longitudinal graphs adjusting for sex, age, recruitment type (self-recruitment or invitation), and COVID-19 status. The inner relationships between mental health, sleep and Covid infection were described through relative importance networks. Finally, we modelled how mental health affects sleep and vice versa using generalized estimating equations with different adjustments. Seasonal and north-south regional variations were found in sleep and mental health outcomes at baseline and attenuated over time. The seasonal variation of sleep and mental health correlated moderately with the incidence rate of COVID-19 in the sample. Networks indicate that the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and mental health varies over time. We observed a bidirectional relationship between sleep quality and quantity at baseline and mental health at follow-up and vice versa. Sleep quality and quantity at baseline was associated with adverse symptom trajectories of mental health at follow-up, and vice versa, during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a weak relationship between COVID-19 incidence, sleep, and mental health.\n",

      "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a profound impact on sleep and psychological well-being for individuals worldwide. This pre-registered investigation extends our prior study by tracking self-reported social jetlag (SJL), social sleep restriction (SSR), and perceived life stress from May 2020 through October 2021. Using web-based surveys, we collected self-reported sleep information with the Ultrashort Munich Chronotype Questionnaire at three additional timepoints (September 2020, February 2021 and October 2021). Further, we measured perceived life stress with the Perceived Stress Scale at two additional timepoints (February 2021 and October 2021). In a subsample of 181, predominantly female (87%), United States adults aged 19-89 years, we expanded our prior findings by showing that the precipitous drop in SJL during the pandemic first wave (May 2020), compared to pre-pandemic (February, 2020), rapidly rose with loosening social restrictions (September 2020), though never returned to pre-pandemic levels. This effect was greatest in young adults, but not associated with self-reported chronotype. Further, perceived life stress decreased across the pandemic, but was unrelated to SJL or SSR. These findings suggest that sleep schedules were sensitive to pandemic-related changes in social restrictions, especially in younger participants. We posit several possible mechanisms supporting these findings.\n",

      "Prevalence and correlates of perinatal depression.\n",
      "This systematic review of systematic reviews aims to provide the first global picture of the prevalence and correlates of perinatal depression, and to explore the commonalities and discrepancies of the literature.\n",
      "Seven databases were searched from inception until April 2022. Full-text screening and data extraction were performed independently by two researchers and the AMSTAR tool was used to assess the methodological quality.\n",
      "128 systematic reviews were included in the analysis. Mean overall prevalence of perinatal depression, antenatal depression and postnatal depression was 26.3%, 28.5% and 27.6%, respectively. Mean prevalence was significantly higher (27.4%; SD = 12.6) in studies using self-reported measures compared with structured interviews (17.0%, SD = 4.5; d = 1.0) and among potentially vulnerable populations (32.5%; SD = 16.7, e.g. HIV-infected African women) compared to the general population (24.5%; SD = 8.1; d = 0.6). Personal history of mental illness, experiencing stressful life events, lack of social support, lifetime history of abuse, marital conflicts, maternity blues, child care stress, chronic physical health conditions, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, being exposed to second-hand smoke and sleep disturbance were among the major correlates of perinatal depression.\n",
      "Although the included systematic reviews were all of medium-high quality, improvements in the quality of primary research in this area should be encouraged. The standardisation of perinatal depression assessment, diagnosis and measurement, the implementation of longitudinal designs in studies, inclusions of samples that better represent the population and better control of potentially confounding variables are encouraged.\n",

      "Examining Stress and Residual Symptoms in Remitted and Partially Remitted Depression Using a Wearable Electrodermal Activity Device: A Pilot Study.\n",
      "Consistent evidence suggests residual symptoms and stress are the most reliable predictors of relapse in remitted depression. Prevailing methodologies often do not enable continuous real-time sampling of stress. Thus, little is known about day-to-day interactions between residual symptoms and stress in remitted depression. In preparation for a full-scale trial, this study aimed to pilot a wrist-worn wearable electrodermal activity monitor: ADI (Analog Devices, Inc.) Study Watch for assessing interactions between physiological stress and residual depressive symptoms following depression remission. 13 individuals remitted from major depression completed baseline, daily diary, and post-daily diary assessments. Self-reported stress and residual symptoms were measured at baseline and post-daily diary. Diary assessments required participants to wear ADI's Study Watch during waking hours and complete self-report questionnaires every evening over one week. Sleep problems, fatigue, energy loss, and agitation were the most frequently reported residual symptoms. Average skin conductance responses (SCRs) were 16.09 per-hour, with an average of 11.30 hours of wear time per-day. Increased residual symptoms were associated with enhanced self-reported stress on the same day. Increased SCRs on one day predicted increased residual symptoms on the next day. This study showed a wearable electrodermal activity device can be recommended for examining stress as a predictor of remitted depression. This study also provides preliminary work on relationships between residual symptoms and stress in remitted depression. Importantly, significant findings from the small sample of this pilot are preliminary with an aim to follow up with a 3-week full-scale study to draw conclusions about psychological processes explored. Clinical and Translational Impact Statemen-ADI's wearable electrodermal activity device enables a continuous measure of physiological stress for identifying its interactions with residual depressive symptoms following remission. This novel procedure is promising for future studies.\n",

      "As the major pathophysiological feature of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is vital for the occurrence of cardiovascular complications. The activation of calpain-1 mediates the production of endothelial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairs nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, resulting in vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED). Ginsenoside Rg1 is thought to against endothelial cell dysfunction, but the potential mechanism of CIH-induced VED remains unclear.\n",

Previous studies have found a close correlation between melatonin and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a trauma- and stress-related psychiatric disorder with symptoms of sleep disturbance. However, it is still unclear if melatonin can have a therapeutic effect on PTSD.\n",
      "This study aimed to investigate the effects of melatonin on foot shocks induced PTSD-like behaviors and abnormal neuroendocrine levels in mice.\n",
      "As compared to no-shock controls, PTSD-like mice spent significantly more time freezing and displayed less rearing in a contextual fear test, spent significantly less time in and had fewer entries into open arms in an elevated maze test, and spent significantly less time in and had fewer entries into a light box in a light-dark transition task. In addition, serum GABA and cortisol levels were both found to be significantly decreased, whereas epinephrine levels were significantly increased in the PTSD-like mice. Our results showed that intraperitoneal injections of melatonin (2 mM, but not 0.2 nor 20 mM, 0.1 ml/day for two consecutive weeks) alleviated PTSD-like behaviors and restored serum GABA and cortisol levels. Further, it was found that melatonin receptor 1/2 antagonist luzindole significantly blocked the beneficial effects of melatonin for PTSD-like behaviors and serum GABA and cortisol levels, whereas melatonin receptor 2 antagonist 4-P-PDOT slightly blocked these effects.\n",

      "Predictors of sleep quality for autistic people across adulthood.\n",
      "Poor sleep can have a significant impact on physical health and well-being. Sleep problems are common among autistic children, but less is known about sleep across the autistic adult lifespan. Autistic adults (n = 730, aged 18-78 years) were recruited via Simons Powering Autism Research for Knowledge Research Match. Participants completed online surveys asking about demographics, health problems, social support, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and overall and specific aspects of sleep quality. Regression analyses explored the variables associated with sleep quality. Physical health, assigned female sex at birth and self-reported anxiety symptoms significantly contributed to models for all aspects of sleep. Perceived stress contributed to models of overall and subjective sleep quality, and daytime dysfunction. Depression symptoms did not contribute significantly to any of the models of sleep quality. However, utilizing government support mechanisms (such as social security) contributed to the model of sleep efficiency. Age contributed little to models of sleep quality, whereas perceived stress and psychotropic medication use contributed to some but not all aspects of sleep. Sleep quality is poor for autistic people across the adult lifespan. Given known impacts of poor sleep on health, cognition and quality of life, attention should be paid to sleep and its possible everyday effects for autistic people of all ages.\n",

      "Emotional Memory Processing during REM Sleep with Implications for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n",
      "REM sleep is important for the processing of emotional memories, including fear memories. Rhythmic interactions, especially in the theta band, between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and limbic structures are thought to play an important role, but the ways in which memory processing occurs at a mechanistic and circuits level are largely unknown. To investigate how rhythmic interactions lead to fear extinction during REM sleep, we used a biophysically based model that included the infralimbic cortex (IL), a part of the mPFC with a critical role in suppressing fear memories. Theta frequency (4-12 Hz) inputs to a given cell assembly in IL, representing an emotional memory, resulted in the strengthening of connections from the IL to the amygdala and the weakening of connections from the amygdala to the IL, resulting in the suppression of the activity of fear expression cells for the associated memory. Lower frequency (4 Hz) theta inputs effected these changes over a wider range of input strengths. In contrast, inputs at other frequencies were ineffective at causing these synaptic changes and did not suppress fear memories. Under post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) REM sleep conditions, rhythmic activity dissipated, and 4 Hz theta inputs to IL were ineffective, but higher-frequency (10 Hz) theta inputs to IL induced changes similar to those seen with 4 Hz inputs under normal REM sleep conditions, resulting in the suppression of fear expression cells. These results suggest why PTSD patients may repeatedly experience the same emotionally charged dreams and suggest potential neuromodulatory therapies for the amelioration of PTSD symptoms.\n",

      "General data and sleep disorders in children with acute leukemia during chemotherapy were collected by general questionnaires, Children's Sleep Disorders Scale and the Parenting Stress Index-short form.\n",
      "In total, 173 valid questionnaires were collected. The total Sleep Disorder Scale score > 39 is considered a sleep disorder, while sleep disorders accounted for 45.66% (79/173). In the cohort, 167 children had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with 40.12% (67/167) having sleep disorders, while six children had acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia, with 50.00% (3/6) having sleep disorders. Single- and multi-factor regression analyses of age, gender, number of children in the family, and time spent using electronic devices showed that factors influencing sleep disorders in these children were mainly parental scolding and adenoid hypertrophy. Children with sleep disorders had more parental stress than those without sleep disorders (P < 0.05).\n",
      "The high incidence of sleep disorders in children with acute leukemia is related to airway conditions and parental behaviors. Sleep disorders in children can increase parenting stress. Factors potentially affecting sleep quality should be addressed as early as possible, while parental education should be strengthened to better facilitate the physical and psychological recovery of their children.\n",

Further, we examined whether co-morbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) influenced changes between subgroups.\n",
      "Quasi-experimental. Latent transition analysis identified distinctive subgroups of SMs and examined transitions between subgroups from admission to discharge.

      "Model fit indices supported a 7-class solution. The seven subgroups of SMs were distinguished by diverging patterns of probability for specific PCS. The Minimal subgroup was most prevalent at discharge (39.4%), followed by the Sleep subgroup (high probability of sleep problems, low probability of other PCS; 26.8%). 41% and 25% of SMs admitted within the Affective (i.e., predominantly affective PCS) and Sleep subgroups remained within the same group at discharge, respectively. The 19% of SMs with co-morbid PTSD were less likely to transition to the Minimal subgroup (odds ratio=0.28; p<.001) and were more likely to remain in their admission subgroup at discharge (35.5% with PTSD vs. 22.2% without).\n",
      "The majority of SMs achieved symptom resolution following participation in the IOP, with most transitioning to subgroups characterized by reduced symptom burden. SMs admitted in the Affective and Sleep subgroups, as well as those with PTSD, were most likely to have continuing clinical needs at discharge, revealing priority targets for resource allocation and follow-up treatment.\n",

      "Sleep disturbance is associated with mental health symptomatology, but this impact is understudied during COVID-19. The aims of this study are to: 1) examine correlates of sleep disturbance, and 2) examine the longitudinal relationship between sleep disturbance and mental health symptoms 6 months later, during the pandemic.\n",
      "Data were analyzed from COVID-19 Survey Canada conducted between May 2020 (T1) and November 2021 (T2) (n = 489). We examined COVID-related baseline correlates of sleep disturbance at T1, and used multivariable regressions to examine the relationship between T1 sleep disturbance and T2 post-traumatic stress (PTS), health anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depressive symptoms, controlling for baseline mental health symptoms and sociodemographics.\n",
      "Females, ages 30-49, and those with an annual household income <$50,000, showed a higher prevalence of clinically significant sleep disturbance. After adjustment, compared to those without sleep disturbance at baseline, those with sleep disturbance showed a significant increase in PTS symptoms at 6 months (b = 11.80, 95% CI = [8.21-15.38], p < 0.001).\n",

      "New approach to establish a surgical planning in infantile vallecular cyst synchronous with laryngomalacia based on aerodynamic analysis.\n",
      "A large proportion of infants with vallecular cyst (VC) have coexisting laryngomalacia (LM). Feeding difficulties, regurgitation, occasional cough, and sleep-disordered breathing are the common symptoms in moderate to severe cases. The surgical management of these cases is more challenging and remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to help surgeons select the effective surgical strategies by computer-aided design (CAD) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the upper airway flow characteristics.\n",
      "The three dimensional (3D) geometric model of the upper airway was reconstructed based on two dimensional (2D) medical images of the patient with VC accompanied with LM. Virtual surgeries were carried out preoperatively to simulate three possible post-operative states in silico. The different outcomes of virtual surgical strategies were predicted based on computational evaluations of airway fluid dynamics including pressure, resistance, velocity, and wall shear stress (WSS).\n",
      "The CFD results of this study suggested the importance of the angle between the rim of epiglottis and arytenoid epiglottic (AE) fold. There was a small impact on the upper airway flow field while the VC was removed and the angle of epiglottis was unchanged. The partial lifting of epiglottis can further improve the flow field. With performing supraglottoplasty (SGP) and the marsupialization of VC, epiglottis was completely recovered, and the flow field was significantly improved. The clinical symptoms of this patient improved greatly after surgeries and no recurrence or growth retardation were noted during 1-year follow-up. The clinical prognosis was consistent with the prediction of the CFD results.\n",
      "The state of epiglottis needs to be carefully checked to evaluate the necessity of performing further SGP in the patients with VC accompanied with LM. CFD and CAD could be developed as a new approach to help surgeons predict the post-operative outcomes through quantification of the airflow dynamics, and make the optimal and individualized surgical approaches for patients with airway obstruction.\n",

      "Circadian rhythms in the blood-brain barrier: impact on neurological disorders and stress responses.\n",
      "Circadian disruption has become more prevalent in society due to the increase in shift work, sleep disruption, blue light exposure, and travel via different time zones. The circadian rhythm is a timed transcription-translation feedback loop with positive regulators, BMAL1 and CLOCK, that interact with negative regulators, CRY and PER, to regulate both the central and peripheral clocks. This review highlights the functions of the circadian rhythm, specifically in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), during both healthy and pathological states. The BBB is a highly selective dynamic interface composed of CNS endothelial cells, astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, and microglia that form the neurovascular unit (NVU). Circadian rhythms modulate BBB integrity through regulating oscillations of tight junction proteins, assisting in functions of the NVU, and modulating transporter functions. Circadian disruptions within the BBB have been observed in stress responses and several neurological disorders, including brain metastasis, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Further understanding of these interactions may facilitate the development of improved treatment options and preventative measures.\n",

      "OxPhos defects cause hypermetabolism and reduce lifespan in cells and in patients with mitochondrial diseases.\n",
      "Patients with primary mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) defects present with fatigue and multi-system disorders, are often lean, and die prematurely, but the mechanistic basis for this clinical picture remains unclear. By integrating data from 17 cohorts of patients with mitochondrial diseases (n = 690) we find evidence that these disorders increase resting energy expenditure, a state termed hypermetabolism. We examine this phenomenon longitudinally in patient-derived fibroblasts from multiple donors. Genetically or pharmacologically disrupting OxPhos approximately doubles cellular energy expenditure. This cell-autonomous state of hypermetabolism occurs despite near-normal OxPhos coupling efficiency, excluding uncoupling as a general mechanism. Instead, hypermetabolism is associated with mitochondrial DNA instability, activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), and increased extracellular secretion of age-related cytokines and metabokines including GDF15. In parallel, OxPhos defects accelerate telomere erosion and epigenetic aging per cell division, consistent with evidence that excess energy expenditure accelerates biological aging. To explore potential mechanisms for these effects, we generate a longitudinal RNASeq and DNA methylation resource dataset, which reveals conserved, energetically demanding, genome-wide recalibrations. Taken together, these findings highlight the need to understand how OxPhos defects influence the energetic cost of living, and the link between hypermetabolism and aging in cells and patients with mitochondrial diseases.\n",

      "The Neurotoxin DSP-4 Dysregulates the Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine System and Recapitulates Molecular and Behavioral Aspects of Prodromal Neurodegenerative Disease.\n",
      "The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is among the earliest sites of tau and α-synuclein pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), respectively. The onset of these pathologies coincides with loss of noradrenergic fibers in LC target regions and the emergence of prodromal symptoms including sleep disturbances and anxiety. Paradoxically, these prodromal symptoms are indicative of a noradrenergic hyperactivity phenotype, rather than the predicted loss of norepinephrine (NE) transmission following LC damage, suggesting the engagement of complex compensatory mechanisms. Because current therapeutic efforts are targeting early disease, interest in the LC has grown, and it is critical to identify the links between pathology and dysfunction. We employed the LC-specific neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4), which preferentially damages LC axons, to model early changes in the LC-NE system pertinent to AD and PD in male and female mice. DSP-4 (two doses of 50 mg/kg, one week apart) induced LC axon degeneration, triggered neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and reduced tissue NE levels. There was no LC cell death or changes to LC firing, but transcriptomics revealed reduced expression of genes that define noradrenergic identity and other changes relevant to neurodegenerative disease. Despite the dramatic loss of LC fibers, NE turnover and signaling were elevated in terminal regions and were associated with anxiogenic phenotypes in multiple behavioral tests. These results represent a comprehensive analysis of how the LC-NE system responds to axon/terminal damage reminiscent of early AD and PD at the molecular, cellular, systems, and behavioral levels, and provides potential mechanisms underlying prodromal neuropsychiatric symptoms.\n",

      "T-cell cellular stress and reticulocyte signatures, but not loss of naïve T lymphocytes, characterize severe COVID-19 in older adults.\n",
      "In children and younger adults up to 39 years of age, SARS-CoV-2 usually elicits mild symptoms that resemble the common cold. Disease severity increases with age starting at 30 and reaches astounding mortality rates that are ~330 fold higher in persons above 85 years of age compared to those 18-39 years old. To understand age-specific immune pathobiology of COVID-19, we have analyzed soluble mediators, cellular phenotypes, and transcriptome from over 80 COVID-19 patients of varying ages and disease severity, carefully controlling for age as a variable. We found that reticulocyte numbers and peripheral blood transcriptional signatures robustly correlated with disease severity. By contrast, decreased numbers and proportion of naïve T-cells, reported previously as a COVID-19 severity risk factor, were found to be general features of aging and not of COVID-19 severity, as they readily occurred in older participants experiencing only mild or no disease at all. Single-cell transcriptional signatures across age and severity groups showed that severe but not moderate/mild COVID-19 causes cell stress response in different T-cell populations, and some of that stress was unique to old severe participants, suggesting that in severe disease of older adults, these defenders of the organism may be disabled from performing immune protection. These findings shed new light on interactions between age and disease severity in COVID-19.\n",

      "Epigenetic modifications and fetal programming: Molecular mechanisms to control hypertension inheritance.\n",
      "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the number 1 cause of death in the United States and hypertension is a highly prevalent risk factor for CVD. It is estimated that up to 50 % of the hypertensive trait is genetically inherited while the other 50 % is determined by modifiable factors involving lifestyle, behaviors, and the environment. Interestingly, the hypertensive trait is induced or inhibited by epigenetic modifications modulated by modifiable factors. This review focused on the underlying mechanisms of stress, sleep deprivation, obesity and sedentarism as key players for epigenetic modifications contributing to the development of the hypertensive trait and, on the other hand, how epigenetic modifications induced by physical exercise and healthier habits may contribute to overturn and prevent the inheritance of hypertension trait. Furthermore, adversities during gestation and perinatal life also increase the risk for hypertension and CVD later in life, which can perpetuate the inheritance of the hypertensive trait whereas healthier habits during gestation and lactation may counteract fetal programming to improve the cardiovascular health of the progeny. Therefore, it is promising that a healthier lifestyle causes long-lasting epigenetic modifications and is transmitted to the next generation, strengthening the fight against the inheritance of hypertension.\n",

      "Remembering and forgetting in sleep: Selective synaptic plasticity during sleep driven by scaling factors Homer1a and Arc.\n",
      "Sleep is a conserved and essential process that supports learning and memory. Synapses are a major target of sleep function and a locus of sleep need. Evidence in the literature suggests that the need for sleep has a cellular or microcircuit level basis, and that sleep need can accumulate within localized brain regions as a function of waking activity. Activation of sleep promoting kinases and accumulation of synaptic phosphorylation was recently shown to be part of the molecular basis for the localized sleep need. A prominent hypothesis in the field suggests that some benefits of sleep are mediated by a broad but selective weakening, or scaling-down, of synaptic strength during sleep in order to offset increased excitability from synaptic potentiation during wake. The literature also shows that synapses can be strengthened during sleep, raising the question of what molecular mechanisms may allow for selection of synaptic plasticity types during sleep. Here I describe mechanisms of action of the scaling factors Arc and Homer1a in selective plasticity and links with sleep need. Arc and Homer1a are induced in neurons in response to waking neuronal activity and accumulate with time spent awake. I suggest that during sleep, Arc and Homer1a drive broad weakening of synapses through homeostatic scaling-down, but in a manner that is sensitive to the plasticity history of individual synapses, based on patterned phosphorylation of synaptic proteins. Therefore, Arc and Homer1a may offer insights into the intricate links between a cellular basis of sleep need and memory consolidation during sleep.\n",

      "Effectiveness of gamified team competition as mHealth intervention for medical interns: a cluster micro-randomized trial.\n",
      "Gamification, the application of gaming elements to increase enjoyment and engagement, has the potential to improve the effectiveness of digital health interventions, while the effectiveness of competition gamification components remains poorly understood on residency. To address this gap, we evaluate the effect of smartphone-based gamified team competition intervention on daily step count and sleep duration via a micro-randomized trial on medical interns. Our aim is to assess potential improvements in the factors (namely step count and sleep) that may help interns cope with stress and improve well-being. In 1779 interns, team competition intervention significantly increases the mean daily step count by 105.8 steps (SE 35.8, p = 0.03) relative to the no competition arm, while does not significantly affect the mean daily sleep minutes (p = 0.76). Moderator analyses indicate that the causal effects of competition on daily step count and sleep minutes decreased by 14.5 steps (SE 10.2, p = 0.16) and 1.9 minutes (SE 0.6, p = 0.003) for each additional week-in-study, respectively. Intra-institutional competition negatively moderates the causal effect of competition upon daily step count by -90.3 steps (SE 86.5, p = 0.30). Our results show that gamified team competition delivered via mobile app significantly increases daily physical activity which suggests that team competition can function as a mobile health intervention tool to increase short-term physical activity levels for medical interns. Future improvements in strategies of forming competition opponents and introducing occasional competition breaks may improve the overall effectiveness.\n",

      "Brief structured respiration practices enhance mood and reduce physiological arousal.\n",
      "Controlled breathwork practices have emerged as potential tools for stress management and well-being. Here, we report a remote, randomized, controlled study (NCT05304000) of three different daily 5-min breathwork exercises compared with an equivalent period of mindfulness meditation over 1 month. The breathing conditions are (1) cyclic sighing, which emphasizes prolonged exhalations; (2) box breathing, which is equal duration of inhalations, breath retentions, and exhalations; and (3) cyclic hyperventilation with retention, with longer inhalations and shorter exhalations. The primary endpoints are improvement in mood and anxiety as well as reduced physiological arousal (respiratory rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability). Using a mixed-effects model, we show that breathwork, especially the exhale-focused cyclic sighing, produces greater improvement in mood (p < 0.05) and reduction in respiratory rate (p < 0.05) compared with mindfulness meditation. Daily 5-min cyclic sighing has promise as an effective stress management exercise.\n",

      "Utility of Wrist-Wearable Data for Assessing Pain, Sleep, and Anxiety Outcomes After Traumatic Stress Exposure.\n",
      "Adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae after traumatic stress exposure are common and have higher incidence among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Pain, depression, avoidance of trauma reminders, reexperiencing trauma, anxiety, hyperarousal, sleep disruption, and nightmares have been reported. Wrist-wearable devices with accelerometers capable of assessing 24-hour rest-activity characteristics are prevalent and may have utility in measuring these outcomes.\n",
      "To evaluate whether wrist-wearable devices can provide useful biomarkers for recovery after traumatic stress exposure.\n",
      "Data were analyzed from a diverse cohort of individuals seen in the emergency department after experiencing a traumatic stress exposure, as part of the Advancing Understanding of Recovery After Trauma (AURORA) study. Participants recruited from 27 emergency departments wore wrist-wearable devices for 8 weeks, beginning in the emergency department, and completed serial assessments of neuropsychiatric symptoms. A total of 19 019 patients were screened. Of these, 3040 patients met study criteria, provided informed consent, and completed baseline assessments. A total of 2021 provided data from wrist-wearable devices, completed the 8-week assessment, and were included in this analysis. The data were randomly divided into 2 equal parts (n = 1010) for biomarker identification and validation. Data were collected from September 2017 to January 2020, and data were analyzed from May 2020 to November 2022.\n",
      "Participants were recruited for the study after experiencing a traumatic stress exposure (most commonly motor vehicle collision).\n",
      "Rest-activity characteristics were derived and validated from wrist-wearable devices associated with specific self-reported symptom domains at a point in time and changes in symptom severity over time.\n",
      "Of 2021 included patients, 1257 (62.2%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 35.8 (13.0) years. Eight wrist-wearable device biomarkers for symptoms of adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae exceeded significance thresholds in the derivation cohort. One of these, reduced 24-hour activity variance, was associated with greater pain severity (r = -0.14; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.07). Changes in 6 rest-activity measures were associated with changes in pain over time, and changes in the number of transitions between sleep and wake over time were associated with changes in pain, sleep, and anxiety. Simple cutoffs for these biomarkers identified individuals with good recovery for pain (positive predictive value [PPV], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82-0.88), sleep (PPV, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.59-0.67, and anxiety (PPV, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.72-0.80) with high predictive value.\n",

      "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking are major cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and CAD share an exciting relationship, and recently, OSA has emerged as a non-traditional CV risk factor. OSA is characterized by episodic sleep state-dependent collapse of the upper airway, resulting in periodic reductions or cessations in ventilation, with consequent hypoxia, hypercapnia, or arousals from sleep. The oxidative stress and vascular inflammation resulting from the nocturnal hypoxia followed by reoxygenation cycles predispose the patients to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Untreated OSA is associated with long-term health consequences, including CVD, metabolic disorders, cognitive impairment, and depression. Paradoxically, some recent studies have reported that patients with OSA may suffer less severe CAD due to the development of collateral circulation due to repetitive hypoxia experienced due to OSA.\n",

      "Job strain has been implicated in a variety of adverse health outcomes, particularly cardiometabolic and inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely unknown. One possibility is that the maladaptive coping response to stress, (perseverative cognition (PC); the cognitive representation of past stressful events (rumination) or feared future events (worry)), either in work or more generally, mediates the relationship between job strain and physical disease. The aim of this study was thus to test the potential role of both general, and work- related PC as a mediating, or potentially moderating, mechanism between job strain and ill- health outcomes.Design & Measures:Using an online cross- sectional design, 650 full- time employees completed measures of job strain, general and work- related PC (rumination & worry) and health outcomes (burnout, somatization, health behaviours & sleep quality).\n",

      "Chronic intermittent hypoxia-induced BNIP3 expression mitigates contractile dysfunction and myocardial injury in animal and cell model via modulating autophagy.\n",
      "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is generally associated with multiple cardiovascular disorders, such as myocardial hypertrophy. Autophagy is strictly modulated to maintain cardiac homeostasis. Post-injury autophagy is closely associated with pathological cardiac hypertrophy. BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and BNIP3-like protein (BNIP3L) can cause cell death and are important for hypoxia-elicited autophagy. Here, we evaluated whether BNIP3 could mitigate functional remodeling and cardiac hypertrophy through regulation of autophagy. Male WT rats or rats with BNIP3 knockout were subjected to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) for 8 h/day over 5 weeks. Echocardiography and morphology were employed to assess the cardioprotective effects. Autophagy was assessed via transmission electron microscopy and detection of LC3, p62, and Beclin-1. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and the Bax/Bcl2 ratio were used to monitor apoptosis. Biochemical evaluations were performed to assess oxidative stress. Additionally, BNIP3-knockdown H9c2 cells that were subjected to CIH were used to examine autophagy and apoptosis to confirm the findings of the animal study. The CIH group showed elevated heart weight/body weight and left ventricle weight/body weight proportions, along with left ventricular remodeling. CIH-exposed rats exhibited dramatically higher fractional shortening and ejection fractions than the controls. In addition, the levels of autophagy markers Beclin-1 and LC3-II/I were increased, whereas the level of p62 was reduced by CIH treatment. The oxidative marker levels and the apoptosis index in the CIH group were markedly increased. Knockout of BNIP3 significantly aggravated the impairment in cardiac function, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and hypertrophy of CIH rats, while significantly reducing autophagy. The autophagy-associated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was also deactivated by BNIP3 knockout. At the cellular level, CIH treatment significantly upregulated autophagy and apoptosis; however, BNIP3 silencing reduced autophagy and promoted apoptosis. CIH treatment-mediated upregulation of BNIP3 expression plays a crucial role in autophagy by targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, alleviating cardiac hypertrophy.\n",

      "Mental health of UK firefighters.\n",
      "Exposure to trauma, high-stress situations, and disrupted sleep are well known risk factors affecting firefighters' mental health. Little is known about the association between firefighters' exposure to fire contaminants and mental health disorders. The UK Firefighter Contamination Survey assessed firefighters' health and capacity for occupational exposure to contaminants. Participants were invited to anonymously complete its 64 questions online. Logistic regression analyses assessed the associations between self-reported mental health disorders and proxies of contaminant exposure. Results found that firefighters who notice soot in their nose/throat for more than a day after attending fires (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.8, 1.4-2.4), and those who remain in their personal protective equipment (PPE) for over 4 h after fires (OR = 1.9, 1.2-3.1), were nearly twice as likely to report mental health disorders. Significantly increased odds ratios for all three outcomes of interest (anxiety, depression and/or any mental health disorders) were also found among firefighters who take PPE home to clean. Sleeping problems were reported by 61% of firefighters. These firefighters were 4.2 times more likely to report any mental health disorder (OR = 4.2, 3.7-4.9), 2.9 times more likely to report anxiety (OR = 2.9, 2.4-3.5) and 2.3 times more likely to report depression (OR = 2.3, 1.9-2.8) when compared to firefighters who did not report sleep issues. Effective decontamination measures within UK Fire and Rescue Services, together with firefighters' wellness, may play a crucial role in protecting firefighters' mental health.\n",

      "Bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity and postural instability are the hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Non-motor symptoms including cognitive, behavioral, and neuropsychiatric changes, sensory and sleep disturbances that may precede the motor symptoms by years. The peculiar pathological features of PD are decreased dopaminergic neurons and dopamine levels in the substantia nigra pars compacta and pontine locus coeruleus. Humanin is produced by a small gene peptide, which is located in the mitochondria genome. Inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and altered transcription have been recognized as causative factors of PD. This evidence has prompted many researchers to focus on studying the functions of DNA and mitochondria. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate Humanin mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PD subjects, compared with those in PBMCs of normal control (NC) subjects.\n",
      "A total of 220 participants, including 154 PD patients (57 females and 97 males; mean age 71.54 years, SD 7.8) and 66 CN (28 females and 38 males; mean age 70.54 years, SD 9.45) were enrolled for the qRT-PCR analysis. Increased Humanin mRNA levels were found in PD samples, compared to controls.\n",
      "In conclusion, the present data confirm the tendency of mitochondria to overexpress mRNA in PD, which could be a cellular attempt to reduce apoptotic damage in PD subjects. Humanin might be useful as a marker for a better diagnosis of PD, and we cannot exclude that in the future it might also play a role on prognosis and in the possible therapies for PD.\n",

      "Consequences of post-weaning sleep deprivation on behaviour and oxidative stress parameters in rat plasma and brain.\n",
      "Sleep is essential for health: Adequate sleep is essential for healthy development and sleep deprivation results in several consequences. Indeed, sleep deprivation early in life is associated with poor behaviour and cognition, as well as impaired mental and physical health. Preclinical studies have shown that sleep deprivation alters several physiological functions later in life such as the cardiovascular, immune and endocrine systems, resulting in altered oxidative states. Most of the preclinical literature is focused on adult animals, and little is known about oxidative alterations during development, especially in the context of sleep deprivation. Hence, we adapted a classic and well-documented model of sleep deprivation, paradoxical sleep deprivation using multiple platforms, for juvenile rats and explored central and peripheral oxidative parameters, as well as the behavioural consequences of sleep deprivation post-weaning. We showed that 96 h of paradoxical sleep deprivation induced a significant reduction in body weight, decreased sucrose preference-a behaviour suggestive of anhedonia-and increased glucose and decreased cholesterol in the plasma. In the brain, we observed a decrease in reduced glutathione levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and an increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels in the hypothalamus, indicating oxidative damage in these regions. Taken together, our findings suggest that paradoxical sleep deprivation during development induces anhedonic behaviour and promotes central and peripheral alterations in oxidative parameters.\n",

      "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often more complicated than a single head injury. An extreme example of this point may be military service members who experience a spectrum of exposures over a prolonged period under stressful conditions. Understanding the effects of complex exposures can inform evaluation and care to prevent persistent symptoms. We designed a longitudinal series of non-invasive procedures in adult mice to evaluate the effects of prolonged mild stress and head injury exposures. We assessed anxiety, depression, and sleep-wake dysfunction as symptoms that impact long-term outcomes after mild TBI. Unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) was generated from a varied sequence of environmental stressors distributed within each of 21 days. Subsequently, mice received a mild blast combined with closed-head mild TBI on 5 days at 24-h intervals. In males and females, UCMS induced anxiety without depressive behavior. A major finding was reproducible sleep-wake dysfunction through 6- to 12-month time points in male mice that received UCMS with repetitive blast plus TBI events, or surprisingly after just UCMS alone. Specifically, male mice exhibited hypersomnia with increased sleep during the active/dark phase and fragmentation of longer wake bouts. Sleep-wake dysfunction was not found with TBI events alone, and hypersomnia was not found in females under any conditions. These results identify prolonged stress and sex differences as important considerations for sleep-wake dysfunction. Furthermore, this reproducible hypersomnia with impaired wakefulness is similar to the excessive daytime sleepiness reported in patients, including patients with TBI, which warrants further clinical screening, care, and treatment development.\n",

      "Does Wearable-Measured Heart Rate Variability During Sleep Predict Perceived Morning Mental and Physical Fitness?\n",
      "The emergence of wearable sensor technology may provide opportunities for automated measurement of psychophysiological markers of mental and physical fitness, which can be used for personalized feedback. This study explores to what extent within-subject changes in resting heart rate variability (HRV) during sleep predict the perceived mental and physical fitness of military personnel on the subsequent morning. Participants wore a Garmin wrist-worn wearable and filled in a short morning questionnaire on their perceived mental and physical fitness during a period of up to 46 days. A custom-built smartphone app was used to directly retrieve heart rate and accelerometer data from the wearable, on which open-source algorithms for sleep detection and artefact filtering were applied. A sample of 571 complete observations in 63 participants were analyzed using linear mixed models. Resting HRV during sleep was a small predictor of perceived physical fitness (marginal R\n",

      "Adverse childhood experiences are associated with vascular changes in adolescents that are risk factors for future cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), such as abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction, are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and indicators of future CVD risk in adulthood, such as greater vascular stiffness. The impact of ACEs in adolescence is unclear, and understanding how ACEs relate to blood pressure (BP) and vascular function during early life is key for the development of prevention strategies to reduce CVD risk. We hypothesized that exposure to ACEs would be associated with changes in central hemodynamics such as increased vascular stiffness and higher BP during adolescence.\n",
      "This pilot study enrolled 86 adolescents recruited from the Children's of Alabama. A validated ACE questionnaire was employed, and ACEs were modeled both as a continuous variable and a categorical variable (ACE ≥ 1 vs. ACE = 0). The primary outcomes used are considered to be indicators of future cardio-renal disease risk: aortic augmentation index normalized to 75 bpm (Alx75, a surrogate for vascular stiffness), carotid-femoral PWV (m/s), and ambulatory BP patterns.\n",
      "Adolescents with ACE ≥ 1 had significantly higher Alx75 (ACE: 5.2% ± 2.2 compared to no ACE: - 1.4% ± 3.0; p = 0.043). PWV only reflected this trend when adjustments were made for the body mass index. Adolescents with ACEs showed no differences in ambulatory BP patterns during the 24-h, wake, or sleep periods compared to adolescents with no ACEs.\n",
      "ACEs were associated with higher AIx75 in adolescence, which is a risk factor for future CVD. Adolescence could present an opportunity for early detections/interventions to mitigate adverse cardiovascular outcomes in adulthood.

      "The potential beneficial effect of sleep deprivation following traumatic events to preventing PTSD: Review of current insight regarding sleep, memory, and trauma resonating with ancient rituals-Àìsùn Oku (African) and Tsuya (Japanese).\n",
      "Sleep figures in numerous ancient texts, for example, Epic of Gilgamesh, and has been a focus for countless mystical and philosophical texts. Even in the present century, sleep remains one of the most complex behaviors whose function still remains to be further explored. Current hypotheses suggest that among other functions, sleep contributes to memory processes. Memory is a core topic of study in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other stress-related phenomena. It is widely accepted that sleep plays a major role in the consolidation of newly encoded hippocampus-dependent memories to pre-existing knowledge networks. Conversely, sleep deprivation disrupts consolidation and impairs memory retrieval. Along this line, sleep deprivation following a potentially traumatic event may interfere with the consolidation of event-related memories and, thereby, may reduce long-term post-traumatic stress-related symptoms. This review consolidates clinical and animal studies on the relationships between sleep, sleep deprivation, memory processes, and trauma exposure while introducing new contemporary insights into an ancient African tribal ritual (Àìsùn Oku) and Japanese ceremony ritual (Tsuya). We propose that these findings, focusing specifically on the effects of sleep deprivation in the immediate aftermath of traumatic events, may be explored as a possible therapeutic measure. Along with a summary of the field questions on whether sleep is performed \"to remember\" or \"to forget\" we lay the rationale for using sleep deprivation as a clinical tool. A tool that may partially prevent the long-term persistence of these traumatic events' memory and thereby, at least partly, attenuating the development of PTSD.\n",

      "Irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia share similar pathophysiologic mechanisms including sensitization of peripheral and central pain pathways, autonomic dysfunction and are often co-diagnosed. Co-diagnosed patients experience increased symptom severity, mental health comorbidities, and decreased quality of life. The role of mind-body interventions, which have significant effects on central pain syndromes and autonomic dysregulation, have not been well-described in co-diagnosed patients. The aim of this state-of-the art narrative review is to explore the relationship between irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia, and to evaluate the current evidence and mechanism of action of mind-body therapies in these two conditions.\n",

      "Measuring depression severity based on facial expression and body movement using deep convolutional neural network.\n",
      "Real-time evaluations of the severity of depressive symptoms are of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In clinical practice, the evaluation approaches are mainly based on psychological scales and doctor-patient interviews, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Also, the accuracy of results mainly depends on the subjective judgment of the clinician. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, more and more machine learning methods are used to diagnose depression by appearance characteristics. Most of the previous research focused on the study of single-modal data; however, in recent years, many studies have shown that multi-modal data has better prediction performance than single-modal data. This study aimed to develop a measurement of depression severity from expression and action features and to assess its validity among the patients with MDD.\n",
      "We proposed a multi-modal deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms in real-time, which was based on the detection of patients' facial expression and body movement from videos captured by ordinary cameras. We established behavioral depression degree (BDD) metrics, which combines expression entropy and action entropy to measure the depression severity of MDD patients.\n",
      "We found that the information extracted from different modes, when integrated in appropriate proportions, can significantly improve the accuracy of the evaluation, which has not been reported in previous studies. This method presented an over 74% Pearson similarity between BDD and self-rating depression scale (SDS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD). In addition, we tracked and evaluated the changes of BDD in patients at different stages of a course of treatment and the results obtained were in agreement with the evaluation from the scales.\n",
      "The BDD can effectively measure the current state of patients' depression and its changing trend according to the patient's expression and action features. Our model may provide an automatic auxiliary tool for the diagnosis and treatment of MDD.\n",

      "Sleep deprivation and NLRP3 inflammasome: Is there a causal relationship?\n",
      "In the modern era, sleep deprivation (SD) is one of the most common health problems that has a profound influence on an individual's quality of life and overall health. Studies have identified the possibility that lack of sleep can stimulate inflammatory responses. NLRP3 inflammasome, a key component of the innate immune responses, initiates inflammatory responses by enhancing proinflammatory cytokine release and caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis. In this study, NLRP3 modification, its proinflammatory role, and potential targeted therapies were reviewed with regard to SD-induced outcomes. A growing body of evidence has showed the importance of the mechanistic connections between NLRP3 and the detrimental consequences of SD, but there is a need for more clinically relevant data. In animal research, (i) some animals show differential vulnerability to the effects of SD compared to humans. (ii) Additionally, the effects of sleep differ depending on the SD technique employed and the length of SD. Moreover, paying attention to the crosstalk of all the driving factors of NLRP3 inflammasome activation such as inflammatory responses, autonomic control, oxidative stress, and endothelial function is highly recommended. In conclusion, targeting NLRP3 inflammasome or its downstream pathways for therapy could be complicated due to the reciprocal and complex relationship of SD with NLRP3 inflammasome activation. However, additional research is required to support such a causal claim.\n",

      "Adolescents get insufficient sleep, adversely affecting health. Mind-body integrative health interventions for adolescents have been shown to reduce stress, a barrier to good sleep. This scoping review aimed to synthesize mind-body integrative health interventions for adolescents, how interventions were implemented, who was reached. A systematic search of four online databases was conducted. Randomized, quasi-experimental, and single-group designs with participants ages 10-24 years were included. Twelve studies covering 10 interventions using mindfulness, qigong, aromatherapy, or yoga were identified. Participants were predominantly female; only one study reported participants' race or ethnicity (81% non-Hispanic white). Most (n=6) interventions were delivered in groups, and half reported significant improvements in subjective sleep quality. Mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy were the most commonly used modalities, with reported impact on sleep outcomes measured objectively. The two interventions that found statistically significant, moderate improvements in objectively-measured sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency were of higher intensity and used mindfulness. Four interventions were self-directed; participants in these struggled with adherence; significant impacts on sleep were not found. While findings were mixed, stemming in part from the quality of the underlying studies, this review identified several promising features of interventions, including using mindfulness, ensuring sufficient intervention dose, and targeting interventions towards adolescents with poor sleep at baseline (rather than a general population of adolescents). The findings suggests that sleep interventions for adolescents may improve psychological well-being as an intermediate effect, as sleep improvements were observed mostly among participants with poor sleep quality or anxiety symptoms at baseline. This review identified several gaps in the literature. Despite documented racial and ethnic disparities in sleep quality among adolescents, published evidence of mind-body integrative health-based sleep interventions among Black and Latinx adolescents is lacking. None of the studies in this review assessed developmental stage or age differences, despite documented differences in sleep across age groups of adolescents. These two gaps in the evidence should be addressed in future intervention research.\n",

Participants found the intervention useful and appreciated the flexibility of an online program; however, finding time to engage in it was challenging. Recruitment of eligible patients with acquired brain disorders and their caregivers as a dyad was challenging.\n",
      "The study confirms prior research suggesting that interventions targeting resilience are feasible, but larger studies with more rigorous methods are needed to appreciate the influence of resilience interventions in persons with brain disorders and their caregivers. Further research is needed to identify the characteristics of those most likely to benefit from resilience interventions and the optimal timing of such interventions.\n",

      "The purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the time perspective and the psychophysiological state of the elderly during the pandemic COVID-19. 433 residents from 11 Russian cities aged 60,8±9,8 years (range - 50-94 years, women - 78,7%) took part in the study. During the online survey, each participant of the study provided personal data (place of residence, sex, age, height, and weight) and completed the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory, the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Yale Food Addiction Scale. It was found that elderly people with a balanced time perspective had the lowest level of depression during the pandemic COVID-19 and less expressed sleep inertia at work days, while those with a past negative time perspective had the highest level of depression, high frequency of detection of food addiction and low sleep efficiency. The other types of time perspective (past positive, present hedonistic, present fatalistic and future) had intermediate values of indicators between these two extreme options. Thus, the conducted studies have shown that elderly people with a balanced time perspective showed the highest level of resistance to psychoemotional stress caused by the pandemic COVID-19.\n",

В исследовании приняли участие 433 жителя 11 городов России в возрасте 60,8±9,8 года (диапазон — 50–94 года, женщины — 78,7%). Каждый участник исследования во время онлайн-опроса указал личные данные (место проживания, пол, возраст, рост, массу тела) и заполнил тест Зимбардо для оценки временно́й перспективы, Мюнхенский тест для оценки хронотипа, шкалу депрессии Бека и Йельскую шкалу для оценки пищевой зависимости. Установлено, что у пожилых людей со сбалансированной временно́й перспективой во время пандемии COVID-19 наблюдался наименьший уровень депрессии и менее выраженная инерция сна в рабочие дни, в то время как у лиц с прошлой негативной временно́й перспективой отмечен наиболее высокий уровень депрессии, высокая частота выявления пищевой зависимости и низкая эффективность сна. Остальные типы временно́й перспективы (прошлая позитивная, настоящая гедонистическая, настоящая фаталистическая и будущая) имели промежуточные показатели между этими двумя крайними вариантами. Таким образом, проведенные исследования показали, что пожилые люди со сбалансированной временно́й перспективой проявили наиболее высокий уровень устойчивости к психоэмоциональному стрессу, вызванному пандемией COVID-19.\n",

      "Stress Estimation Using Biometric and Activity Indicators to Improve QoL of the Elderly.\n",
      "It is essential to estimate the stress state of the elderly to improve their QoL. Stress states change every day and hour, depending on the activities performed and the duration/intensity. However, most existing studies estimate stress states using only biometric information or specific activities (e.g., sleep duration, exercise duration/amount, etc.) as explanatory variables and do not consider all daily living activities. It is necessary to link various daily living activities and biometric information in order to estimate the stress state more accurately. Specifically, we construct a stress estimation model using machine learning with the answers to a stress status questionnaire obtained every morning and evening as the ground truth and the biometric data during each of the performed activities and the new proposed indicator including biological and activity perspectives as the features. We used the following methods: Baseline Method 1, in which the RRI variance and Lorenz plot area for 4 h after waking and 24 h before the questionnaire were used as features; Baseline Method 2, in which sleep time was added as a feature to Baseline Method 1; the proposed method, in which the Lorenz plot area per activity and total time per activity were added. We compared the results with the proposed method, which added the new indicators as the features. The results of the evaluation experiments using the one-month data collected from five elderly households showed that the proposed method had an average estimation accuracy of 59%, 7% better than Baseline Method 1 (52%) and 4% better than Baseline Method 2 (55%).\n",

      "The effects of stress may be alleviated when its impact or a decreased stress-resilience are detected early. This study explores whether wearable-measured sleep and resting HRV in police officers can be predicted by stress-related Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) measures in preceding days and predict stress-related EMA outcomes in subsequent days. Eight police officers used an Oura ring to collect daily Total Sleep Time (TST) and resting Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and an EMA app for measuring demands, stress, mental exhaustion, and vigor during 15-55 weeks. Vector Autoregression (VAR) models were created and complemented by Granger causation tests and Impulse Response Function visualizations. Demands negatively predicted TST and HRV in one participant. TST negatively predicted demands, stress, and mental exhaustion in two, three, and five participants, respectively, and positively predicted vigor in five participants. HRV negatively predicted demands in two participants, and stress and mental exhaustion in one participant. Changes in HRV lasted longer than those in TST. Bidirectional associations of TST and resting HRV with stress-related outcomes were observed at a weak-to-moderate strength, but not consistently across participants. TST and resting HRV are more consistent predictors of stress-resilience in upcoming days than indicators of stress-related measures in prior days.\n",

      "Multiplatform-Integrated Identification of Melatonin Targets for a Triad of Psychosocial-Sleep/Circadian-Cardiometabolic Disorders.\n",
      "Several psychosocial, sleep/circadian, and cardiometabolic disorders have intricately interconnected pathologies involving melatonin disruption. Therefore, we hypothesize that melatonin could be a therapeutic target for treating potential comorbid diseases associated with this triad of psychosocial-sleep/circadian-cardiometabolic disorders. We investigated melatonin's target prediction and tractability for this triad of disorders. The melatonin's target prediction for the proposed psychosocial-sleep/circadian-cardiometabolic disorder triad was investigated using databases from Europe PMC, ChEMBL, Open Targets Genetics, Phenodigm, and PheWAS. The association scores for melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 with this disorder triad were explored for evidence of target-disease predictions. The potential of melatonin as a tractable target in managing the disorder triad was investigated using supervised machine learning to identify melatonin activities in cardiovascular, neuronal, and metabolic assays at the cell, tissue, and organism levels in a curated ChEMBL database. Target-disease visualization was done by graphs created using \"igraph\" library-based scripts and displayed using the Gephi ForceAtlas algorithm. The combined Europe PMC (data type: text mining), ChEMBL (data type: drugs), Open Targets Genetics Portal (data type: genetic associations), PhenoDigm (data type: animal models), and PheWAS (data type: genetic associations) databases yielded types and varying levels of evidence for melatonin-disease triad correlations. Of the investigated databases, 235 association scores of melatonin receptors with the targeted diseases were greater than 0.2; to classify the evidence per disease class: 37% listed psychosocial disorders, 9% sleep/circadian disorders, and 54% cardiometabolic disorders. Using supervised machine learning, 546 cardiovascular, neuronal, or metabolic experimental assays with predicted or measured melatonin activity scores were identified in the ChEMBL curated database. Of 248 registered trials, 144 phase I to IV trials for melatonin or agonists have been completed, of which 33.3% were for psychosocial disorders, 59.7% were for sleep/circadian disorders, and 6.9% were for cardiometabolic disorders. Melatonin's druggability was evidenced by evaluating target prediction and tractability for the triad of psychosocial-sleep/circadian-cardiometabolic disorders. While melatonin research and development in sleep/circadian and psychosocial disorders is more advanced, as evidenced by melatonin association scores, substantial evidence on melatonin discovery in cardiovascular and metabolic disorders supports continued R&D in cardiometabolic disorders, as evidenced by melatonin activity scores. A multiplatform analysis provided an integrative assessment of the target-disease investigations that may justify further translational research.\n",

      "A 31-year-old man hospitalized during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 suffering from severe psychological distress, requested psychological assistance as his condition progressively worsened, eventually requiring intubation. After being referred to the clinical psychology service by a ward physician, the patient was assisted remotely for two months for a total of 22 sessions during hospitalization and after discharge. A psychometric evaluation was carried out when the patient was close to discharge and longitudinally, for a total of four times, for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7)), post-traumatic stress disorder (Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R)) and insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)). Support was provided remotely, mainly through audio and video calls, and text chats were also utilized when possible and as required. The initial psychometric evaluation indicated moderate depression, severe anxiety, the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder and sleep problems. Psychological distress decreased until reaching a situation of no distress in the final evaluation. Psychological interventions from which the patient benefitted were stress reduction and breathing techniques, empathic support, elaboration of the possibility of grief and cognitive restructuring regarding fears relative to his condition. Psychological support provided remotely and the monitoring of psychological status after discharge are highly advisable in pandemic emergency situations. The CARE checklist of information to include when writing a case report was utilized in the writeup of this case report.\n",

      "Lifestyle, Insulin Resistance and Semen Quality as Co-Dependent Factors of Male Infertility.\n",
      "Infertility is a problem that affects millions of couples around the world. It is known as a disease of couples, not individuals, which makes diagnosis difficult and treatment unclear. Male infertility can have many causes, from mechanical ones to abnormal spermatogenesis or spermiogenesis. Semen quality is determined by a number of factors, including those dependent on men themselves, with the number of infertile men growing every year. These include, e.g., diet, physical activity, sleep quality, stress, among many others. As these factors co-exist with insulin resistance, which is a disease closely related to lifestyle, it has been singled out in the study due to its role in affecting semen quality. In order to examine connections between lifestyle, insulin resistance, and semen quality, a review of literature published from 1989 to 2020 in the following databases PubMed/Medline, EMBASE (Elsevier), Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was performed. Hence, semen quality, environment, and insulin resistance are interrelated, thus it is difficult to indicate which aspect is the cause and which is the effect in a particular relationship and the nature of possible correlations. Since the influence of lifestyle on semen quality has been extensively studied, it is recommended that more thorough research be done on the relationship between insulin resistance and semen quality, comparing the semen quality of men with and without insulin resistance.\n",

      "Effects of Game Weekly Frequency on Subjective Training Load, Wellness, and Injury Rate in Male Elite Soccer Players.\n",
      "To compare the effects of playing one or two games per week on subjective perceived exertion (RPE) and (RPE-based) training load, monotony index, sleep, stress, fatigue, and muscle soreness (Hooper index), total mood disturbance, and injury rate in elite soccer players. Fourteen males from a first-division soccer club (age: 24.42 ± 4.80 years) competed in two games per week for six weeks and one game per week for twelve weeks (a total of 24 games). Paired t-tests and non-parametric Wilcoxon signed ranks evaluated the significance of the differences (p < 0.05). The main findings were that RPE was significantly larger when playing two games per week compared with one game. However, subject total and mean training load, mood disturbance, monotony, and subjective perception of sleep, stress, fatigue, muscle soreness monitoring (Hooper index), and the number of injuries were not different. The findings suggested that competing in two matches per week does not negatively influence injury rate and players’ perceptions of training load or wellness, even though players perceive two games per week as more physically demanding compared with one game per week.\n",

      "Factors Associated with the Prevalence and Severity of Menstrual-Related Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\n",
      "This study aimed to identify factors associated with the prevalence and severity of menstrual-related symptoms. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021208432). We conducted literature searches of PubMed and Ichushi-Web and used the Jonna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist to assess the quality. Of the 77 studies included in the meta-analysis, significant odds ratios (ORs) were obtained for eight factors associated with primary dysmenorrhea (PD): age ≥ 20 years (OR: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04−1.34), body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.01−2.26), longer menstrual periods (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.04−0.28), irregular menstrual cycle (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.13−1.45), family history of PD (OR: 3.80; 95% CI: 2.18−6.61), stress (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.30−2.72), sleeping hours < 7 h (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.04−1.35), and bedtime after 23:01 (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.16−1.45). Two factors were associated with severity of PD (moderate vs. severe): BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.01−3.54) and smoking (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.08−3.47). PD severity (mild vs. severe) and prevalence of premenstrual syndrome were associated with BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.04−3.50) and smoking (OR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.31−2.66), respectively. The identified risk factors could be utilized to construct an appropriate strategy to improve menstrual symptoms and support women’s health.\n",

      "Workplace bullying (WB) studies focusing on perpetrators are increasing. Many processes, events, circumstances and individual states are being studied to understand and inhibit what causes some employees to become perpetrators. Using a 24-week diary design and drawing on the Conservation of Resources Theory, we investigated how sleep, physical activity (PA), and being bullied predicted perpetration on a within-level. On a between-level, we controlled for a supervisory position, psychological distress and mental illnesses over 38 employees from Spain and Turkey. Their average age was 38.84 years (\n",

      "Association between Family Support, Stress, and Sleep Quality among College Students during the COVID-19 Online Learning Period.\n",
      "(1) Background: During the past 3 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the normal school schedule of college students, jeopardizing their mental health, sleep quality, and interpersonal relationships. However, previous studies have focused on the dimension of social support received, and few studies have measured in depth the association of support received from family on adolescents’ physical and mental health. Therefore, this study explored the associations between family support received by Chinese college students during COVID-19 pandemic online classes, stress and sleep quality, and the mediating role of stress. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted at Chongqing Medical University recruited 712 college students through a university-wide incidental random sample using the Questionnaire Star platform. Statistical description and correlation analysis was conducted using SPSS 25.0, and structural equation modeling was constructed using AMOS 22.0 to test for mediating effects; (3) Results: The family support score of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic online course was 19.41 ± 4.62. Correlation analysis showed that sleep quality was negatively correlated with family support (r = −0.224, p < 0.01), positively correlated with stress (r = 0.324, p < 0.01), and family support was negatively correlated with stress (r = −0.159, p < 0.01). The results of structural equation modeling showed that stress partially mediated the relationship between family support and sleep quality among college students (indirect effect = −0.150, p < 0.01, SE = 0.013,95% CI = [−0.208, −0.064]). The model R2 was 36.4%. (4) Conclusions: Schools should consider implementing sleep education, and stress relief curriculum measures to improve the quality of students’ sleep, and should focus on the role that family plays during online classes. This will help students overcome the negative emotional effects of stress in the COVID-19 pandemic and improve their learning efficiency and physical and mental health.\n",

      "Occupational stress and shift work (including night shift work) are associated with physical and psychological health consequences in healthcare providers in general and those working in psychiatric establishments in particular. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of occupational risk factors and unscheduled night-time naps on self-reported health disorders among nurses working in a French psychiatric hospital.\n",
      "We performed a 12-month observational field study of experienced nurses working at Philippe Pinel Psychiatric Hospital (Amiens, France) between September 2018 and September 2019. A comparative descriptive study of two groups of nurses who filled out a questionnaire on health and occupational stress was performed: nurses working permanently on the night shift (the night shift group, who took unscheduled naps), and nurses rotating weekly between morning and afternoon shifts (the day shift group).\n",
      "The night and day shift groups comprised 53 and 30 nurses, respectively. There were no intergroup differences in health disorders, sleep quality, occupational stress, and risk factor perception. Correlation analyses showed that in the day shift group, a low level of support from supervisors was associated with elevated levels of distress, anxiety, and gastrointestinal disorders. In the night shift group, a greater overall work load was associated with elevated levels of anxiety and distress. These findings indicated that the nurses on the night shift had adapted well to their working conditions.\n",

      "Older adults are more likely to have age-related sleep problems, which may result in the reduction of cognitive functions. This study was designed to examine the relationship between sleep onset problem and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) among community-dwelling older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. In this study, 186 older adults aged 65 and above were enrolled and were instructed to respond to an online survey. This survey comprised questions regarding sleep quality (four items such as sleep duration, use of sleep medication), SCC (six domains), and sociodemographic information (eight items such as age, gender, stress condition). We classified the participants into two groups according to the presence or absence of sleep onset problem and examined the relationship between each SCC domain. The sleep onset problem (+) (n = 70) group had significantly higher frequency of scheduled memory decline, misplacement, disorientation in time, word recall decline, and forgetfulness. Furthermore, the sleep onset problem affected the participants' scheduled memory after adjusted for potential covariates (OR, 2.28; 95%CI, 1.13-4.73; p = 0.02). Older adults with sleep onset problem may need to be evaluated for SCC and supported in term of both sleep status and SCC.\n",

      "Investigation of Psychological Stress and Sleep Quality of Emergency Medical Technicians in Taiwan Fire Department during the COVID-19 Pandemic.\n",
      "When the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began to ravage the world in 2019, the World Health Organization became concerned. The epidemic has a high mortality and contagion rate, with severe health and psychological impacts on frontline emergency medical service system practitioners. There are many hospital staff surveys, but few have covered the stress among emergency medical technicians. DASS-21, PSQI, and AUDIT questionnaires were used to evaluate the sources of psychological stress factors of firefighters in Taiwan. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the questionnaire content. We conducted questionnaire surveys from May 2022 to July 2022. Our sample comprised 688 participants. The odds ratios of increased depression, anxiety, and stress levels due to reduced family or peer understanding and support were 2.72 (95% CI: 1.50−4.92), p = 0.001; 2.03 (95% CI: 1.11−3.68), p = 0.021; and 3.27 (95% CI: 1.83−5.86), p < 0.001, respectively. The odds ratios of poor sleep quality due to depression, anxiety, and increased stress levels were 5.04 (3.18−7.99), p < 0.001; 2.44 (95% CI: 1.57−3.81), p < 0.001; and 4.34 (95% CI: 2.76−6.82), p-value < 0.001, respectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic, poor sleep quality and a lack of understanding and support from the Taiwan firefighting agency staff, family, or peers resulted in increased depression, anxiety, and stress levels.\n",

      "The Mediating Role of Sleep Quality in the Relationship between Negative Emotional States and Health-Related Quality of Life among Italian Medical Students.\n",
      "Sleep problems have been shown to be related to adverse outcomes concerning physical and mental well-being. Furthermore, mental health issues and sleep problems were reported to be highly prevalent among medical students and physicians, and were found to be associated with worse academic and clinical performance in these populations. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep to examine the associations between sleep quality and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and to explore the possible mediating role of sleep in the relationship between psychological distress and HRQoL itself in a sample of medical and dental students attending a large Italian university.

      "Factors Associated with Mental Health among Malaysian University Music Students: Roles of Fear of COVID-19, Nomophobia, Loneliness, Sleep Quality, and Socioeconomic Status.\n",
      "Previous mental health studies have shown higher levels of anxiety, stress, and depression symptoms among university music students. In general, some similar findings have been observed for Malaysian music university students. In diagnosing the complications of mental health, there is consensus that it is essential to develop and evaluate a model oriented toward mental health illness prevention and treatment. To date, a suitable pattern for estimating mental health in terms of anxiety, stress, and depression among music university students is lacking. To fill this gap, we collected the necessary data from 691 music and 871 general students who were students for one year. The introduced pattern includes socioeconomic status, fear of COVID-19, nomophobia, sleep quality, loneliness, and mental health. Our data analysis proved that the levels of anxiety, depression, and stress of music students were lower than those of general students. Unlike some previous studies, in this study, the fear of COVID-19 and nomophobia didn't have the most significant impact on mental health. The most significant impacts were related to sleep quality and loneliness. These findings have the potential to inform health promotion and services in the music education system.\n",

      "Effects of intra-hippocampal corticosterone and sleep on consolidation of memories of aversive experience in rats.\n",
      "Formation and consolidation of memories for highly stressful (traumatic) events is a complex process that involves interplay between multiple memory systems and has implications for etiology and treatment of stress- and trauma-related disorders. Here we study effects of sleep/wake states and high intra-hippocampal corticosterone on consolidation of aversive contextual memories, as well as consolidation of association between auditory unpaired phasic background cues and fear response in rats. Animals were implanted with EEG and EMG electrodes for sleep assessment and cannulas for intra-hippocampal corticosterone application. They were familiarized to a \"safe box\" and then trained in a fear conditioning paradigm in a distinct \"shock box\" with a prominent unpaired phasic background auditory cue. Immediately after conditioning, animals received bilateral intra-hippocampal saline (1 μl) or corticosterone (10 ng in 1 μl) injection and were either allowed to sleep or were kept awake for a following two-hour consolidation period. Memory tests 24 h later revealed that the saline-injected animals that slept during consolidation had significantly stronger fear responses in the shock box compared to the safe box as well as increased fear response in response to the auditory cue. Lack of sleep during the consolidation period in saline injected animals led to generalization of the fear response to the safe context, while association between auditory cue and fear response was preserved. High intra-hippocampal corticosterone levels during memory consolidation led to generalization of fear response to the safe context, regardless of sleep/wake state, while enhancement of response to auditory cue was not observed. Our results show how manipulation of conditions during consolidation can lead to greatly variable memories for an aversive episode with distinct behavioral outcomes. Observed overgeneralization of fear to safe context and altered fear response to background phasic cue has implications for understanding etiology of pathological memory alternations in stress-related conditions e.g., in posttraumatic stress disorder in humans.\n",

      "Modelling the effects of the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin on the life cycle of the soil dwelling annelid Enchytraeus crypticus, an original experimental design to calibrate a DEB-TKTD model.\n",
      "The Dynamic Energy Budget theory (DEB) enables ecotoxicologists to model the effects of chemical stressors on organism life cycles through the coupling of toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK-TD) models. While good progress has been made in the application of DEB-TKTD models for aquatic organisms, applications for soil fauna are scarce, due to the lack of dedicated experimental designs suitable for collecting the required time series effect data. Enchytraeids (Annelida: Clitellata) are model organisms in soil ecology and ecotoxicology. They are recognised as indicators of biological activity in soil, and chemical stress in terrestrial ecosystems. Despite this, the application of DEB-TKTD models to investigate the impact of chemicals has not yet been tested on this family. Here we assessed the impact of the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin on the life cycle of Enchytraeus crypticus. We developed an original experimental design to collect the data required for the calibration of a DEB-TKTD model for this species. E. crypticus presented a slow initial growth phase that has been successfully simulated with the addition of a size-dependent food limitation for juveniles in the DEB model. The DEB-TKTD model simulations successfully agreed with the data for all endpoints and treatments over time. The highlighted physiological mode of action (pMoA) for cypermethrin was an increase of the growth energy cost. The threshold for effects on survival was estimated at 73.14 mg kg\n",

      "Use of serial smartphone-based assessments to characterize diverse neuropsychiatric symptom trajectories in a large trauma survivor cohort.\n",
      "The authors sought to characterize adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS) symptom trajectories across ten symptom domains (pain, depression, sleep, nightmares, avoidance, re-experiencing, anxiety, hyperarousal, somatic, and mental/fatigue symptoms) in a large, diverse, understudied sample of motor vehicle collision (MVC) survivors. More than two thousand MVC survivors were enrolled in the emergency department (ED) and completed a rotating battery of brief smartphone-based surveys over a 2-month period. Measurement models developed from survey item responses were used in latent growth curve/mixture modeling to characterize homogeneous symptom trajectories. Associations between individual trajectories and pre-trauma and peritraumatic characteristics and traditional outcomes were compared, along with associations within and between trajectories. APNS across all ten symptom domains were common in the first two months after trauma. Many risk factors and associations with high symptom burden trajectories were shared across domains. Both across and within traditional diagnostic boundaries, APNS trajectory intercepts, and slopes were substantially correlated. Across all domains, symptom severity in the immediate aftermath of trauma (trajectory intercepts) had the greatest influence on the outcome. An interactive data visualization tool was developed to allow readers to explore relationships of interest between individual characteristics, symptom trajectories, and traditional outcomes ( http://itr.med.unc.edu/aurora/parcoord/ ). Individuals presenting to the ED after MVC commonly experience a broad constellation of adverse posttraumatic symptoms. Many risk factors for diverse APNS are shared. Individuals diagnosed with a single traditional outcome should be screened for others. The utility of multidimensional categorizations that characterize individuals across traditional diagnostic domains should be explored.\n",

      "Tenuifolin ameliorates the sleep deprivation-induced cognitive deficits.\n",
      "Tenuifolin (TEN), a natural neuroprotective compound obtained from the Polygala tenuifolia Willd plant, has improved cognitive symptoms. However, the impact of TEN on memory impairments caused by sleep deprivation (SD) is unclear. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to investigate the mechanisms behind the preventative benefits of TEN on cognitive impairment caused by SD. TEN (10 and 20 mg/kg) and Huperzine A (0.1 mg/kg) were given to mice through oral gavage for 28 days during the SD process. The results indicate that TEN administrations improve short- and long-term memory impairments caused by SD in the Y-maze, object identification, and step-through tests. Moreover, TEN stimulated the generation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-10), lowered the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and interleukin-18), and activated microglia, improving antioxidant status in the hippocampus. TEN treatments significantly boosted the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 while considerably decreasing the expression of NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 and caspase-1 p20. Additionally, TEN restored the downregulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling cascade and the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis induced by SD. When considered collectively, our data suggest that TEN is a potentially effective neuroprotective agent for cognition dysfunction.\n",

      "Acute sleep deprivation exacerbates systemic inflammation and psychiatry disorders through gut microbiota dysbiosis and disruption of circadian rhythms.\n",
      "Acute sleep deprivation (ASD) is often observed in shift workers and characterized by drowsiness and unrelenting exhaustion. The physiological and psychological effects of ASD include anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, systemic inflammation, stress responses, and disruptions of gut microbiota. However, the mechanisms involved in the ASD-associated circadian dysregulations with regard to gut dysbiosis, systemic inflammation, physiological modulation, and psychiatry disorders remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether central nervous system disorders induced by ASD are related to inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and circadian dysregulation. We also assessed impacts on microbiota succession. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly allocated to the control and sleep deprivation (SD) groups. Mice in the SD group were subjected to 72 h of paradoxical SD using the modified multiple-platform method for ASD induction (72 h rapid eye movement-SD). The effects of ASD on dietary consumption, behaviors, cytokines, microbiota, and functional genes were determined. The appetite of the SD group was significantly higher than that of the control group, but the body weight was significantly lower than that of the control group. The anxiety-like behaviors were found in the SD group. Alpha and beta diversity of microbiota showed significant decrease after ASD induction; the relative abundance of Candidatus_Arthromitus and Enterobacter was increased, whereas that abundance of Lactobacillus, Muribaculum, Monoglobus, Parasutterella, and others was decreased in the SD group. These effects were accompanied by reduction in fecal propionic acid. In the proximal colon, the SD group exhibited significantly higher inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]) and dysregulation of the circadian rhythms (brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 [BMAL1] and cryptochrome circadian regulator 1 [CRY1]) and tight junction genes (occludin [OCLN]) than the control group. Gut barrier dysfunction slightly increased the plasma concentration of lipopolysaccharide and significantly elevated TNF-α. Inflammatory signals might be transduced through the brain via TNF receptor superfamily member 1 A (TNFRSF1A), which significantly increased the levels of microglia activation marker (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 [IBA1]) and chemokine (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM1]) in the cerebral cortex.

Anthropometric measures, biological parameters, dietary survey and psychological scores were performed.\n",
      "The average age of our population was 48.73 ± 7.7 years, with a female predominance. All three groups showed a significant decrease in weight, BMI and waist circumference with p < .05. Only the prebiotic and probiotic group showed a significant decrease in fat mass (p = .001) and a significant increase in muscle strength with p = .008 and .004, but the differences were not significant between the three groups. Our results showed also a significant decrease in insulinemia and HOMA-IR in the prebiotic group compared to the diet-alone group (p = .03; p = .012) and the probiotic group showed a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose compared to the diet alone group (p = .02).

This study aims to investigate the levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms and to identify associated factors among Bangladeshi physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n",
      "A cross-sectional study using an online survey following a convenience sampling technique was conducted between April 21 and May 10, 2020. Outcomes assessed included demographic questions, COVID-19 related questions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).\n",
      "The survey was completed by 412 Bangladeshi physicians. The findings revealed that, in terms of standardized HADS cut-off points, the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among physicians was 67.72% and 48.5% respectively. Risk factors for higher rates of anxiety or depressive symptoms were: being female, physicians who had experienced COVID-19 like symptoms during the pandemic, those who had not received incentives, those who used self-funded personal protective equipment (PPE), not received adequate training, lacking perceived self-efficacy to manage COVID-19 positive patients, greater perceived stress of being infected, fear of getting assaulted/humiliated, being more connected with social media, having lower income levels to support the family, feeling more agitated, less than 2 h of leisure activity per day and short sleep duration. All these factors were found to be positively associated with anxiety and depression in unadjusted and adjusted statistical models.\n",
      "This study identifies a real concern about the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among Bangladeshi physicians and identifies several associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the vulnerability of the physicians in this extraordinary period whilst they are putting their own lives at risk to help people infected by COVID-19, health authorities should address the psychological needs of medical staff and formulate effective strategies to support vital frontline health workers.\n",

      "Scalable, Technology-enabled Mindfulness, Safety, and Health Promotion Program for Corrections Professionals: An Innovative Protocol.\n",
      "Correction professionals are a highly-stressed workforce with heightened risks for depression, suicide, obesity, cardiovascular disease and injury. These professionals, largely hidden from view, have received little study concerning means to improve their safety, health and well-being. In other settings mindfulness has resulted in lowered stress, along with other benefits. We hypothesized that a feasible, scalable program that promoted mindfulness along with more typical health and safety components, could uniquely benefit corrections professionals.\n",
      "This project will assess a novel program to enhance the mindfulness, safety and health of a vulnerable worker group.\n",
      "In partnership with the Oregon Department of Corrections (DOC), we are conducting a prospective quasi-experimental trial of a safety, health, and mindfulness program among 100 corrections professions from three institutions. Survey and physiologic data will be collected at enrollment, upon weekly program completion (3-months) and at 9-months after enrollment. Primary outcomes are behaviors promoted by the program: being mindful; healthier eating; more physical activity; and greater restorative sleep. Secondary downstream benefits are anticipated in stress level, mood, life satisfaction, positive feelings about the organization, vascular health, and cellular aging, along with job performance, injuries and economic costs. Participants will meet in person as three to five member co-worker groups during their usual work hours for 30-minute sessions once a week for 12-weeks. The program uses self-guided interactive online learning modules that include brief mindfulness practice. Daily mindfulness practice are encouraged between sessions and facilitated by the study website. The module format emphasizes prerequisite knowledge, peer support, skill practice, and enhancing self-efficacy for change. The program continues through self-directed use of the Headspace® application following the 12 weekly sessions.\n",
      "Participants are being enrolled and intervention is ready to launch.\n",
      "Although mindfulness training has gained traction for worker well-being, the need for a skilled trainer and long duration weekly meetings can limit its feasibility. The planned program is an innovative combination of technology, a group format, and a scalable design to add mindfulness to a safety and health curriculum.\n",

The main purpose of the current study is to examine the state of NES, and to explore its relationship with selected factors (e.g. sociodemographic factors, lifestyle habits, body mass index \"BMI\", and mental health) among a sample of undergraduates.\n",
      "A cross-section design was done among undergraduates recruited from three universities in the southern part of Palestine. Students completed a self-administrated questionnaire including demographic information, lifestyle habits, medical profile, and the Arabic version of Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ). Mental health status was also assessed using the Arabic version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Cronbach alpha was used to check the reliability of the Arabic version of NEQ. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate approach.\n",

It is found that 141 university students (29.7%) screened positive for NES. According to univariate analysis, NES was significantly related to gender (p = 0.023), major (p = 0.005), personal monthly income (p = 0.007), source of funding (p = 0.005), and mental health (p < 0.005). Besides, the results of binary logistic regression revealed that having mental health problems (Exp (B) = 4.18; 95% CI = 2.50-6.98; p = 0.000), males (Exp (B) = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.17-3.39; p = 0.014), and those who study expenses was not covered either by scholarship or parents (Exp (B) = 2.75; 95% CI = 1.29-5.8; p = 0.08) were significantly associated with NES.\n",

There is evidence that adolescents had higher prevalence of NES in comparison to other age groups. Moreover, Former studies indicated that anxiety, stress, and depression may be correlated with NES and weight gain. The current outcomes showed that 29.3% of university students complying with symptoms consistent with the diagnostic criteria for NES. The findings also pointed out that gender, field of study, monthly income, source of funding, and mental health is a significantly associated with NES.\n",

      "Increased interaction between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria following sleep deprivation.\n",
      "Prolonged cellular activity may overload cell function, leading to high rates of protein synthesis and accumulation of misfolded or unassembled proteins, which cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to re-establish normal protein homeostasis. Previous molecular work has demonstrated that sleep deprivation (SD) leads to ER stress in neurons, with a number of ER-specific proteins being upregulated to maintain optimal cellular proteostasis. It is still not clear which cellular processes activated by sleep deprivation lead to ER- stress, but increased cellular metabolism, higher request for protein synthesis, and over production of oxygen radicals have been proposed as potential contributing factors. Here, we investigate the transcriptional and ultrastructural ER and mitochondrial modifications induced by sleep loss.\n",
      "We used gene expression analysis in mouse forebrains to show that SD was associated with significant transcriptional modifications of genes involved in ER stress but also in ER-mitochondria interaction, calcium homeostasis, and mitochondrial respiratory activity. Using electron microscopy, we also showed that SD was associated with a general increase in the density of ER cisternae in pyramidal neurons of the motor cortex. Moreover, ER cisternae established new contact sites with mitochondria, the so-called mitochondria associated membranes (MAMs), important hubs for molecule shuttling, such as calcium and lipids, and for the modulation of ATP production and redox state. Finally, we demonstrated that Drosophila male mutant flies (elav > linker), in which the number of MAMs had been genetically increased, showed a reduction in the amount and consolidation of sleep without alterations in the homeostatic sleep response to SD.\n",
      "We provide evidence that sleep loss induces ER stress characterized by increased crosstalk between ER and mitochondria. MAMs formation associated with SD could represent a key phenomenon for the modulation of multiple cellular processes that ensure appropriate responses to increased cell metabolism. In addition, MAMs establishment may play a role in the regulation of sleep under baseline conditions.\n",

      "Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and the periphery. Most 5-HT (~99%) is found in the periphery where it regulates the function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is an important regulator of platelet aggregation. However, the remaining 1% that is found in the central nervous system (CNS) can regulate a range of physiological processes such as learning and memory formation, mood, food intake, sleep, temperature and pain perception. More recent work on the CNS of invertebrate model systems has shown that 5-HT can directly regulate lifespan.This chapter will focus on detailing how CNS 5-HT signalling is altered with increasing age and the potential consequences this has on its ability to regulate lifespan.\n",

      "T-cell cellular stress and reticulocyte signatures, but not loss of naïve T lymphocytes, characterize severe COVID-19 in older adults.\n",
      "In children and younger adults up to 39 years of age, SARS-CoV-2 usually elicits mild symptoms that resemble the common cold. Disease severity increases with age starting at 30 and reaches astounding mortality rates that are ~330 fold higher in persons above 85 years of age compared to those 18-39 years old. To understand age-specific immune pathobiology of COVID-19 we have analyzed soluble mediators, cellular phenotypes, and transcriptome from over 80 COVID-19 patients of varying ages and disease severity, carefully controlling for age as a variable. We found that reticulocyte numbers and peripheral blood transcriptional signatures robustly correlated with disease severity. By contrast, decreased numbers and proportion of naïve T-cells, reported previously as a COVID-19 severity risk factor, were found to be general features of aging and not of COVID-19 severity, as they readily occurred in older participants experiencing only mild or no disease at all. Single-cell transcriptional signatures across age and severity groups showed that severe but not moderate/mild COVID-19 causes cell stress response in different T-cell populations, and some of that stress was unique to old severe participants, suggesting that in severe disease of older adults, these defenders of the organism may be disabled from performing immune protection. These findings shed new light on interactions between age and disease severity in COVID-19.\n",

      "This is a cross-sectional study that used an online survey to target suspected COVID-19 cases in quarantine facilities. Data were collected on several aspects of participants' sociodemographic characteristics, sleep disturbance, and mental health status. Depression, anxiety, stress scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to measure both the psychological impact and mental health status.\n",
      "Of the 362 people who took the survey, 234 (64.6%) were men, and 148 were between the ages of 26-35. Poor sleep was found to be prevalent in 65% of study participants. The rates of individuals reporting severe depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were 14.6%, 15%, and 15%, respectively. According to the findings, there were significant gender differences in depression and anxiety (p = 0.001). When compared to the other age groups, participants aged 26-35 reported the highest level of stress (p = 0.001). Being male [OR = -1.23, 95% CI (-2.75-1.95) P = 0.050], single [OR = 0.98, CI (0.15-4.20), P = 0.001], and a healthcare worker [OR = -2.20, 95% CI (-2.59-1.82), P = 0.001] were all associated with poor sleep quality.\n",
      "Approximately-one-third of quarantine COVID-19 patients had poor sleep quality with mild-moderate depression. Both anxiety and stress scales were prevalent in nearly half of the studied samples.\n",

      "Is it time to rethink education and training? Learning how to perform under pressure: An observational study.\n",
      "Emergency medicine workers are exposed daily to various stressors, especially work-related stress, which have been aggravated by the current SARS-CoV 2 pandemic and impact their physical and mental wellbeing. Nonetheless, although the efficacy of programs and strategies to improving the health of medical staff and patient care has been demonstrated, such programs and strategies are scarce. To assess the prevalence, types and consequences of stress in emergency medical workers in healthcare institutions and explore tools to cope with stressful situations at workplace. Two surveys were conducted. Survey 1 assessed the subjective stress levels and stressors of 21 emergency medicine professionals. Survey 2 was conducted amongst 103 healthcare workers at 3 hospitals in Germany. It comprised selected aspects of the German Mental Risk Assessment and a validated workload scale. None. The answer frequencies on Likert scales were descriptively evaluated. Survey 1: Emergency medical professionals experienced and reported the following high stress levels in acute situations: multitasking during a complex situation; factors associated with the work environment; fear of not appropriately controlling the situation; and lack of sleep. Survey 2: The highest stress levels were experienced in the areas \"work environment\" and \"work organization.\" The highest scores on the workload scale were obtained for statements on work division, exhaustion, insufficient patient care due to time constraints, regulations, and lack of information. Approximately 80% of healthcare workers had experienced emotionally stressful situations at the workplace, and > 30% had lost a colleague to suicide. There are effective and proven methods to learn how to deal with stress that can easily be established in everyday clinical practice. Healthcare workers are subjected to numerous stressors in their work environment and observe the consequences of these stressors on their own and their colleagues' wellbeing. Coping strategies for high-pressure reduces and resists the job- immanent pressure and stress in healthcare workers.\n",

      "Although the efficacy of evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been well established, high rates of treatment dropout and/or nonresponse or under-response to treatment suggest a need to explore novel treatment approaches. Most current research has focused on DSM-based categorical outcomes as primary indicators of treatment response, which may obscure the phenotypic heterogeneity of PTSD and limit the ability to map symptoms to underlying neurobiology. This systematic review aimed to identify intermediate phenotypes (IPs) of PTSD and evaluate IP sensitivity to PTSD treatments.\n",

      "The paucity of research combined with the heterogeneity of study methodologies and significant study limitations makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding IP sensitivity to treatment. However, the existing body of research incorporating this framework shows potential for the IP approach to improve the translation of treatment efficacy from clinical trials to clinical settings.

      "Reduction of blood pressure and improvement of stress and sleep disorders in patients with essential hypertension were important factors. Auricular acupressure was an appropriate complementary therapy for the elderly with essential hypertension for whom pharmacological therapy was not available.\n",
      "This study was a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The experimental group (n = 23) received 8 weeks of auricular acupressure intervention on specific acupoints (superior triangular fossa, Shenmen, kidney, heart, occiput) related to blood pressure, pulse rate, stress, and sleep, whereas the control group (n = 23) received auricular acupressure on nonspecific acupoints. The primary outcomes were the systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured weekly. The secondary outcomes were the pulse rate, heart rate variability, actigraphy measured through Fitbit, and the PSQI were measured before and after the experiment. There were statistically significant differences in systolic blood pressure (F = 5.67, p = .022), diastolic blood pressure (17.53, p < .001), and pulse rate (F = 6.78, p = .013) over time. Stress index (χ2 = 2.12, p = .040) and sleep efficiency (χ2 = 3.57, p = .001) were also significantly different before and after the experiment. However, there was no significant difference in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.\n",

      "Changes in Peripheral Brachial Blood Pressure from Supine to Lateral Decubitus Position in Hypertensive and Normotensive Subjects.\n",
      "Arterial blood pressure is crucial for supplying the nutritional demands of the all body tissues and is also under tight control for the same. The day to day stress impacts the blood pressure (BP), which is effectively corrected by the baroreceptors mechanism. The effect of lateral decubitus position on the blood pressure with respect to supine position needs to be evaluated as it impacts the haemodynamics. The peripheral brachial blood pressure changes are studied among the normotensives and hypertensives with its significance from change in supine to lateral decubitus position. Sixty (60) normotensives and 60 hypertensive subjects were evaluated for arterial blood pressure measurement using mercury sphygmomanometer by gold standard auscultatory method in the supine, right and left lateral decubitus position. The same observer measured the blood pressure at the similar point of time for all the participants. The Supine and lateral decubitus Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Mean±SD) parameters were recorded and compared using the paired 't' test (Supine Normotensives SBP 112.5±16.9, DBP 70.1±17.7 mm of Hg; Hypertensives Stage I SBP 130.2±14.5, DBP 85.2±2.8 mm of Hg; Hypertensive Stage II SBP 152.6 ±17.5, DBP 98.4±9.5mm of Hg). The mean and percentage change in systolic and diastolic BP for Normotensives from supine to right lateral position- SBP 11.6 mm of Hg (10.3%), DBP 8.8 mm of Hg (12.5%) and supine to left lateral position SBP 12.5mm of Hg (11.1%), DBP 9.9 mm of Hg (14.1%) p<0.05, for Hypertensives Stage I supine to right lateral position SBP 13.8 mm of Hg (10.5%), DBP 14.8 mm of Hg (17.37%) and supine to left lateral position SBP 13.5 mm of Hg (10.3%), DBP 12.3 mm of Hg (14.13%) p<0.05 and for Hypertensive Stage II from supine to right lateral position SBP 22.6 mm of Hg (14.8%), DBP 16.6 mm of Hg (16.8%), form supine to left lateral position SBP 12.3mm of Hg (8%), DBP 14.7mm of Hg (14.9%) p<0.01) changed significantly among the all the groups with respect to change from supine to lateral decubitus position. The fall in diastolic BP was of greater magnitude than the systolic BP. The right lateral decubitus position was dominant among the hypertensives for producing the change as compared to left lateral decubitus position. However among the normotensives it was left lateral decubitus which produced greater reduction in blood pressure. The lateral decubitus position definitively reduces the blood pressure as compared to supine position and the changes produced can't be simply ascribed to the hydrostatic effect of gravity on blood column. Sleeping on lateral side could thus be advantageous in reducing the arterial blood pressure.\n",

      "Environmental Factors Impacting Wellness in the Trauma Provider.\n",
      "The purpose of this review is to evaluate the recent literature on environmental factors impacting wellness for the acute care surgeon. This includes factors influencing physical, mental, and emotional well-being.\n",
      "Recent studies have identified challenges to surgeon wellness including increased incidence of sleep deprivation, musculoskeletal pain and injuries, pregnancy complications, moral injury, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and burnout. Qualitative studies have characterized the surgeon's emotional response to occupational stress, adverse events, and surgical complications. Further descriptive studies offer interventions to prevent moral injury after adverse events and to improve surgeon work environment.\n",
      "Acute care surgeons are at increased risk of sleep deprivation, musculoskeletal pain and injury, pregnancy complications, moral injury, PTSD, and burnout. Surgeons experience feelings of isolation and personal devaluation after adverse events or complications, and this may lead to practice limitation and progression to PTSD and/or burnout. Interventions to provide mentorship, peer support, and education may help surgeons recover after adverse events. Further study is necessary to evaluate institution-driven interventional opportunities to improve surgeon well-being and to foster an inclusive and supportive environment.\n",

      "Working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic have affected health professionals' quality of sleep. To date, most of the studies that assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep have been carried out with front-line health personnel, and almost none of them have been carried out with managers.\n",
      "To evaluate the quality of sleep and the level of stress in nurse managers during the early and late stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "Cross-sectional studies were carried out at two time points: after the lockdown period (July 2020) and a year and a half after the start of the pandemic (October 2021). A total of 102 nurse managers of a tertiary hospital were invited to participate. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were administered to assess stress levels and sleep quality.\n",
      "The response rate was 85.2% in 2020 and 81.3% in 2021. Nursing managers showed alterations in sleep quality throughout the pandemic: 70.1% after confinement and 61.4% at the beginning of the second wave. In addition to stress, the fear of contagion by COVID-19 influenced sleep problems. More than a year after the start of the pandemic, the professionals' fear of contagion decreased. Perceived stress also decreased, but sleep disturbances remained.\n",
      "High stress and poor sleep quality among nurse managers require special attention, and specific interventions need to be implemented. Hospitals should develop programs that help nurse managers develop skills to mitigate stress levels and thus improve sleep quality and professional quality of life.\n",

      "Sleep disorders are a common health problem in modern society. Long-term sleep deficiency increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease. However, the exact mechanisms by which sleep deficiency affects Alzheimer's disease remain unclear. Therefore, we reviewed the relevant studies and investigated the role of sleep deprivation in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Sleep deficiency was found to be associated with oxidative stress, β-amyloid protein deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation, which are known to increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease. In addition, insufficient sleep also increases glucocorticoid levels, decreases brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and reduces the number of synapses in the central nervous system. These factors also promote Alzheimer's disease development and progression. The present study showed that a growing body of evidence supports an association between sleep disturbances and Alzheimer's disease. It discusses the role of sleep insufficiency in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, which may provide a theoretical basis for effective treatment and prevention strategies.\n",

      "In response to the new round of COVID-19 outbreaks since March 2022, universities with high outbreak rates around the country have taken quarantine measures to contain the epidemic. Evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks has shown that people under quarantine are at risk for mental health disorders. To better understand the impacts of this round of COVID-19 quarantine on domestic college students and their responses, we conducted a systematic survey to assess the stress and anxiety, and to evaluate effective measurements in this population. We searched relevant documents and literature, and designed a questionnaire from six aspects, including psychological status, epidemic situation, study, daily life, sports, and interpersonal communication, with 51 items in total. We sent the questionnaire on the Wenjuanxing Web platform, from April 2 to 8, 2022. We evaluated the mental status according to parts of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21), and investigated the influencing risk factors and countermeasures. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Chi-square test and multi-variable logistic regression. In total, 508 college respondents were recruited in our survey, and the pooled prevalence of mild anxiety (GAD score ≽ 5, or DASS-21 anxiety score ≽ 8) or stress (DASS-21 pressure score ≽ 14) caused by the new round of COVID-19 pandemic quarantine was 19.69% (100/508).

      "The COH-FIT survey has been translated into 30 languages (two blind forward-translations, consensus, one independent English back-translation, final harmonization). To measure mental health, 1-4 items (\"COH-FIT items\") were extracted from validated questionnaires (e.g. Patient Health Questionnaire 9). COH-FIT items measured anxiety, depressive, post-traumatic, obsessive-compulsive, bipolar and psychotic symptoms, as well as stress, sleep and concentration. COH-FIT Items which correlated r ≥ 0.5 with validated companion questionnaires, were initially retained. A P-score factor structure was then identified from these items using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) on data split into training and validation sets. Consistency of results across languages, gender and age was assessed.\n",

Concurrent validity was consistently demonstrated across different languages for COH-FIT items. CFA confirmed EFA results of five first-order factors (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic, psychotic, psychophysiologic symptoms) and revealed a single second-order factor P-score, with high internal reliability (ω = 0.95).

      "Family members who care for elderly people experience high levels of chronic stress because of the intensive assistance they provide permanently to those who are losing their autonomy. Often considered a burden, this stress causes serious consequences to their health and worsens their quality of life (QoL). Reducing caregivers' chronic stress via self-hypnosis protocols may be an effective treatment. The objective is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptance of self-hypnosis protocols taught by hypnotherapy-trained nurses to reduce the chronic stress of in-family caregivers.\n",
      "This study is a prospective, monocentric, non-blinded, parallel, pilot, randomised waitlist-controlled trial that will be conducted at the University Hospital of Reunion Island. Sixty participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: a self-hypnosis group (intervention) or a waitlist control group. After an 8-week training programme, intervention participants will practice self-hypnosis for ten minutes/day over 8 weeks and subsequently be followed up for 16 weeks thereafter. The primary outcome is to assess the feasibility of a 16-week self-hypnosis protocol for in-family caregivers. Secondary outcomes include the evaluation of the effects of practising self-hypnosis among in-family caregivers of elderly people concerning their stress levels, sleep disorders, levels of fatigue, and QoL at 2, 4 and 8 months on an exploratory basis.\n",

Since lifestyle is key for preventing these adverse health outcomes, we examined the association between a Mediterranean lifestyle and GDF-15 serum concentrations in Spanish older adults.\n",
      "We used cross-sectional data from 2502 older adults participating in the Seniors ENRICA-2 cohort. Adherence to the Mediterranean lifestyle was assessed with the 27-item MEDLIFE index, divided into three blocks: 1) \"Mediterranean food consumption, 2) Mediterranean dietary habits, 3) Physical activity, rest, social habits, and conviviality\". Analyses of the association between the MEFLIFE index and GDF-15 concentrations were performed using multivariable linear regression models adjusting for the main potential confounders.\n",
      "The MEDLIFE index was inversely associated with GDF-15. Compared with participants in the lowest quartile of the MEDLIFE score, GDF-15 mean percentage differences (95% CI) were -3.0% (-8.0, 2.3) for the second quartile, -8.7% (-13.0, -4.1) for the third quartile, and -10.1% (-15.0, -4.9) for the fourth quartile (p-trend<0.001). Block 3 of MEDLIFE, and particularly doing sufficient physical activity, adequate sleep duration, and participating in collective sports, was individually linked to lower concentrations of GDF-15. Results remained similar after excluding participants with cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, or obesity.\n",

      "Emotion regulation difficulties in the relation between stress-related insomnia symptoms and brain response to emotional faces: An fMRI study.\n",
      "The aim of the current study was to investigate whether the experience of insomnia symptoms per se and symptoms of insomnia due to stress are associated with an increased brain response to the presentation of emotional faces. In addition, we also examined whether the effect of these sleep difficulties on emotional reactivity at the brain level depends on the experience of emotion regulation (ER) difficulties. The current sample consisted of 37 individuals (20 females, 17 males) selected from a larger group of 120 respondents who completed a survey about sleep problems and ER difficulties. Our results indicate that the tendency to experience stress-related insomnia symptoms but not insomnia symptoms per se modulates brain responses to emotional facial expressions, especially in areas of the parietal cortex, insula, and surrounding opercular voxels. Furthermore, difficulties in ER might play an important role, as the effect of stress-related insomnia symptoms on most of these brain regions disappears when controlling for difficulties in ER. However, an effect in the insula was maintained during the presentation of angry faces, suggesting that stress-related insomnia symptoms may increase the brain response to anger in the insula relatively independent from difficulties in ER. These findings suggest that individuals affected by stress-related insomnia symptoms show an enhanced brain response when presented with emotional stimuli (either positive or negative) in brain areas associated with hyperarousal, which could represent a possible ER deficit in these individuals. Thus, interventions that focus on targeting ER difficulties might be effective in reducing the hyperarousal state in individuals affected by stress-related insomnia symptoms.\n",

      "Specific subfields within the hippocampus have shown vulnerability to chronic stress, highlighting the importance of looking regionally within the hippocampus to understand the role of psychosocial factors in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. A systematic review on psychosocial factors and hippocampal subfield volumes was performed and showed inconsistent results, highlighting the need for future studies to explore this relationship. The current study aimed to explore the association of psychosocial factors with hippocampal (subfield) volumes, using high-field 7T MRI. Data were from the Memory Depression and Aging (Medea)-7T study, which included 333 participants without dementia. Hippocampal subfields were automatically segmented from T2-weighted images using ASHS software. Generalized linear models accounting for correlated outcomes were used to assess the association between subfields (i.e., entorhinal cortex, subiculum, Cornu Ammonis [CA]1, CA2, CA3, dentate gyrus, and tail) and each psychosocial factor (i.e., depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, childhood maltreatment, recent stressful life events, and social support), adjusted for age, sex, and intracranial volume. Neither depression nor anxiety was associated with specific hippocampal (subfield) volumes. A trend for lower total hippocampal volume was found in those reporting childhood maltreatment, and a trend for higher total hippocampal volume was found in those who experienced a recent stressful life event. Among subfields, low social support was associated with lower volume in the CA3 (B = -0.43, 95% CI: -0.72; -0.15). This study suggests possible differential effects among hippocampal (subfield) volumes and psychosocial factors.\n",

      "Dietary polyphenols and their relationship to the modulation of non-communicable chronic diseases and epigenetic mechanisms: A mini-review.\n",
      "Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) have been considered a global health problem, characterized as diseases of multiple factors, which are developed throughout life, and regardless of genetics as a risk factor of important relevance, the increase in mortality attributed to the disease to environmental factors and the lifestyle one leads. Although the reactive species (ROS/RNS) are necessary for several physiological processes, their overproduction is directly related to the pathogenesis and aggravation of NCDs. In contrast, dietary polyphenols have been widely associated with minimizing oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition to their antioxidant power, polyphenols have also drawn attention for being able to modulate both gene expression and modify epigenetic alterations, suggesting an essential involvement in the prevention and/or development of some pathologies. Therefore, this review briefly explained the mechanisms in the development of some NCDs, followed by a summary of some evidence related to the interaction of polyphenols in oxidative stress, as well as the modulation of epigenetic mechanisms involved in the management of NCDs.\n",

      "The purpose of this study was to assess which combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to running-related injury (RRI)among adolescent cross-country, track, and long-distance runners. We conducted a retrospective study at a hospital-affiliated sports injury prevention centre of 130 adolescent runners (F: 62.1%, M: 37.9%; cross-country: 34.1%, track: 56.1%, long-distance running: 9.8%) who underwent an Injury Prevention Evaluation between 2013 and 2021. The evaluation included a questionnaire on personal and training factors, and standardised physical assessments. We used a binomial logistic regression to assess the influence of demographics, lower extremity strength and alignment, training (running volume and intensity, weight training), and dietary factors on RRIs. There were 38 adolescent runners who reported RRIs (ankle sprains: N = 16, shin splints: N = 9, stress fractures: N = 13). Female sex (odds ratio [OR]: 4.58 [1.37, 15.37]; \n",

      "Ongoing postoperative pain assessments are vital to optimizing pain management and attenuating the development of poor health outcomes after surgery. This study aimed to characterize acute multidimensional trajectories of pain impact on physical function, sleep, mood and stress and examine clinical characteristics and demographics associated with trajectory membership. Additionally, this study compared levels of pain intensity and prescription opioid use at two-weeks and one month postoperatively, across acute symptom trajectories.\n",
      "Participants (N = 285) undergoing total knee arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, and spinal fusion procedures were recruited for this multisite prospective observational study. Longitudinal, joint k-means clustering was used to identify trajectories based on pain impact on activity, sleep, mood, and stress.\n",
      "Three distinct pain impact trajectories were observed: Low (33.7%), Improving (35.4%), and Persistently High (30.9%). Participants in the Persistently High Impact trajectory reported pain interfering moderately to severely with activity, sleep, mood, and stress. Relative to other trajectories, the Persistently High Impact trajectory was associated with greater postoperative pain at one month postoperatively. Preoperatively, participants in the Persistently High Impact trajectory reported worse Pain Catastrophizing Scale Scores, PROMIS Pain Interference, PROMIS Anxiety, and PROMIS Social Isolation scores than participants presenting with other trajectories. No statistical differences in opioid utilization were observed across trajectories.\n",

      "Fluid intelligence is seen as a beneficial attribute, protecting against stress and ill-health. Whether intelligence provides resilience to the cognitive effects of insufficient sleep was tested in the current pre-registered experimental study. Participants (N = 182) completed the Raven's test (measuring fluid intelligence) and a normal night of sleep or a night of total sleep deprivation. Sleepiness and four cognitive tests were completed at 22:30 hours (baseline), and the following day after sleep manipulation. At baseline, higher fluid intelligence was associated with faster and more accurate arithmetic calculations, and better episodic memory, but not with spatial working memory, simple attention or sleepiness. Those with higher fluid intelligence were more, not less, impacted by sleep deprivation, evident for arithmetic ability, episodic memory and spatial working memory. We need to establish a more nuanced picture of the benefits of intelligence, where intelligence is not related to cognitive advantages in all situations.\n",

      "This study investigated the association between fair and supportive leadership and symptoms of burnout and insomnia in police employees. Burnout and insomnia can have negative consequences for health, performance, and safety among employees in the police profession, and risk and protective factors should be thoroughly investigated.\n",
      "Data were collected in a police district in Norway through questionnaires administered in October 2018 and May 2019. The sample consisted of 206 police employees (52% males), with an average age of 42 years and 16 years of experience in the police occupation.\n",
      "The results showed that a high degree of fair and supportive leadership was associated with lower levels of burnout and insomnia six months later. Fair and supportive leadership explained a greater amount of variance in burnout compared to insomnia. This finding indicates that fair and supportive leadership is a more important buffer factor against burnout than it is against insomnia. Stress was positively associated with burnout and insomnia, whereas quantitative job demands had no significant association with the concepts.\n",
      "Fair and supportive leadership can help protect employees from adverse consequences of stress and contribute to improved occupational health, whereas a low degree of support and fair treatment from leaders can both represent a stressor by itself and contribute to poorer coping of stressful events at work. The important role of leadership should be incorporated in measures aimed at preventing and reducing burnout and sleep problems.\n",

      "Neuro-immune-endocrine mechanisms with poor adherence to aromatase inhibitor therapy in breast cancer.\n",
      "As the most commonly used endocrine therapy regimen for patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer (BC) at present, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) reduce the risk of localized and distant recurrence, contralateral BC and secondary cancer, and prolong disease-free survival. Clinical data show that poor adherence during AI treatment is mainly attributed to muscle and joint pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances during treatment. The rapid decline of estrogen caused by AIs in a short period of time enhances sympathetic activity, activates T cells in the body, produces inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-17A, and promotes the occurrence of inflammation and bone loss. This article reviewed the mechanism of poor dependence on AIs in BC patients from the neuro-immuno-endocrine (NIE) perspective and provided clues for clinical intervention against poor adherence.\n"
