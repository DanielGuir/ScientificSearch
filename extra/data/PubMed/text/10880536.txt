The well defined, immature murine dendritic cell (DC) line D1 was used to study the role of DC maturation in CTL induction in vitro and in vivo. Maturation of D1 cells, characterized by markedly increased expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules, was induced by incubation with lipopolysaccharide, agonistic CD40 antibody, or specific CD4(+) T helper (Th) cells. Activated, but not immature, D1 cells efficiently primed alloreactive T cell responses in vitro. Similarly, priming of CTL immunity in vivo in CD4-depleted mice was only observed if these mice were immunized with activated D1 cells. This study provides formal evidence that activation of DCs, induced by Th-independent as well as Th-dependent stimuli, is essential for efficient induction of CTL responses.
