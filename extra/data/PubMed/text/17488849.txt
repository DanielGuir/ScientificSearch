Comparative genomic approaches are useful in identifying molecular differences between organisms. Currently available methods fail to identify small changes in genomes, such as expansion of short repetitive motifs and to analyse divergent sequences. In this report, we describe an anchor-based whole genome comparison (ABWGC) method. ABWGC is based on random sampling of anchor sequences from one genome, followed by analysis of sampled and homologous regions from the target genome. The method was applied to compare two strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551 and H37Rv. ABWGC was able to identify a total of 104 indels including 20 expansion of short repetitive sequences and five recombination events. It included 18 new unidentified genomic differences. ABWGC also identified 188 SNPs including eight new ones. The method was also used to compare M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. avium genomes. ABWGC was able to correctly pick 1002 additional indels (size >100 nt) between the two organisms in contrast to MUMmer, a popular tool for comparative genomics. ABWGC was able to identify correctly repeat expansion and indels in a set of simulated sequences. The study also revealed important role of small repeat expansion in the evolution of M. tuberculosis strains.
