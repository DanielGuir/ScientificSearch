Histone acetylation plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression. The chromatin structure and accessibility of genes to transcription factors is regulated by enzymes that acetylate and deacetylate histones. The Sin3A corepressor complex recruits histone deacetylases and in many cases represses transcription. Here, we report that SAP30L, a close homolog of Sin3-associated protein 30 (SAP30), interacts with several components of the Sin3A corepressor complex. We show that it binds to the PAH3/HID (Paired Amphipathic Helix 3/Histone deacetylase Interacting Domain) region of mouse Sin3A with residues 120-140 in the C-terminal part of the protein. We provide evidence that SAP30L induces transcriptional repression, possibly via recruitment of Sin3A and histone deacetylases. Finally, we characterize a functional nucleolar localization signal in SAP30L and show that SAP30L and SAP30 are able to target Sin3A to the nucleolus.
