Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and high-density microarrays, we have measured the distribution of the global transcription regulator protein, FNR, across the entire Escherichia coli chromosome in exponentially growing cells. Sixty-three binding targets, each located at the 5' end of a gene, were identified. Some targets are adjacent to poorly transcribed genes where FNR has little impact on transcription. In stationary phase, the distribution of FNR was largely unchanged. Control experiments showed that, like FNR, the distribution of the nucleoid-associated protein, IHF, is little altered when cells enter stationary phase, whilst RNA polymerase undergoes a complete redistribution.
