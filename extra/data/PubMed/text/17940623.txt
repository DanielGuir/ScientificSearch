Cancer is a complex and dynamic disease, involving a variety of changes in gene expression and structure. Traditionally, the study of cancer has focused on protein-coding genes, considering these as the principal effectors and regulators of tumorigenesis. Recent advances, however, have brought non-protein-coding RNA into the spotlight. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), one such class of non-coding RNAs, have been implicated in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis [1]. While their study is still at an early stage, and their mechanism of action along with their importance in cancer is not yet fully understood, they may provide an important layer of genetic regulation in tumorigenesis, and ultimately become valuable therapeutic tools.
