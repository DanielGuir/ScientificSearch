DSHIFT is a web server for predicting chemical shifts of DNA sequences in random coil form or double helical B-form. The prediction methods are based on sets of published reference chemical shift values and correction factors which account for shielding or deshielding effects from neighboring nucleotides. Proton, carbon and phosphorus chemical shift predictions are available for random coil DNAs. For double helical B-DNA, only proton chemical shift prediction is available. Results from these predictions will be useful for facilitating NMR resonance assignments and investigating structural features of solution DNA molecules.
