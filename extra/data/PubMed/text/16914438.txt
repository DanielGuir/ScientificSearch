A single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein (SSB) that binds to specific upstream sequences of alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris has been isolated and identified as zeta crystallin (ZTA1). The cDNA encoding P.pastoris ZTA1 (PpZTA1) was cloned into an Escherichia coli expression vector, the recombinant PpZTA1 was expressed and purified from E.coli cell lysates. The DNA-binding properties of recombinant PpZTA1 are identical to those of the SSB present in P.pastoris cell lysates. PpZTA1 binds to ssDNA sequences >24 nt and its DNA-binding activity is abolished by NADPH. This is the first report on the characterization of DNA-binding properties of a yeast ZTA1.
