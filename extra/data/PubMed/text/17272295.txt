Here we report that Rrp14p/Ykl082p is associated with pre-60S particles and to a lesser extent with earlier 90S pre-ribosomes. Depletion of Rrp14p inhibited pre-rRNA synthesis on both the 40S and 60S synthesis pathways. Synthesis of the 20S precursor to the 18S rRNA was largely blocked, as was maturation of the 27SB pre-rRNA to the 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. Unexpectedly, Rrp14p-depleted cells also showed apparently specific cell-cycle defects. Following release from synchronization in S phase, Rrp14p-depleted cells uniformly arrested in metaphase with short mitotic spindles that were frequently incorrectly aligned with the site of bud formation. In the absence of Bub2p, which is required for the spindle orientation checkpoint, this metaphase arrest was not seen in Rrp14p-depleted cells, which then arrested with multiple buds, several SPBs and binucleate mother cells. These data suggest that Rrp14p may play some role in cell polarity and/or spindle positioning, in addition to its function in ribosome synthesis.
