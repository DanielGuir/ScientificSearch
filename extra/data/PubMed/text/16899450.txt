In this paper we develop a new method for genotyping Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. The method is based on (i) using multiple arrays at the same time to determine the genotypes and (ii) a model that relates intensities of individual SNPs to each other. The latter point allows us to annotate SNPs that have poor performance, either because of poor experimental conditions or because for one of the alleles the probes do not behave in a dose-response manner. Generally, our method agrees well with a method developed by Affymetrix. When both methods make a call they agree in 99.25% (using standard settings) of the cases, using a sample of 113 Affymetrix 10k SNP arrays. In the majority of cases where the two methods disagree, our method makes a genotype call, whereas the method by Affymetrix makes a no call, i.e. the genotype of the SNP is not determined. By visualization it is indicated that our method is likely to be correct in majority of these cases. In addition, we demonstrate that our method produces more SNPs that are in concordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium than the method by Affymetrix. Finally, we have validated our method on HapMap data and shown that the performance of our method is comparable to other methods.
