The VISTA portal for comparative genomics is designed to give biomedical scientists a unified set of tools to lead them from the raw DNA sequences through the alignment and annotation to the visualization of the results. The VISTA portal also hosts the alignments of a number of genomes computed by our group, allowing users to study the regions of their interest without having to manually download the individual sequences. Here we describe various algorithmic and functional improvements implemented in the VISTA portal over the last 2 years. The VISTA Portal is accessible at http://genome.lbl.gov/vista.
