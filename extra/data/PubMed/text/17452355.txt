Oxazole-containing macrocycles represent a promising class of anticancer agents that target G-quadruplex DNA. We report the results of spectroscopic studies aimed at defining the mode, energetics and specificity with which a hexaoxazole-containing macrocycle (HXDV) binds to the intramolecular quadruplex formed by the human telomeric DNA model oligonucleotide d(T2AG3)4 in the presence of potassium ions. HXDV binds solely to the quadruplex nucleic acid form, but not to the duplex or triplex form. HXDV binds d(T2AG3)4 with a stoichiometry of two drug molecules per quadruplex, with these binding reactions being coupled to the destacking of adenine residues from the terminal G-tetrads. HXDV binding to d(T2AG3)4 does not alter the length of the quadruplex. These collective observations are indicative of a nonintercalative 'terminal capping' mode of interaction in which one HXDV molecule binds to each end of the quadruplex. The binding of HXDV to d(T2AG3)4 is entropy driven, with this entropic driving force reflecting contributions from favorable drug-induced alterations in the configurational entropy of the host quadruplex as well as in net hydration. The 'terminal capping' mode of binding revealed by our studies may prove to be a general feature of the interactions between oxazole-containing macrocyclic ligands (including telomestatin) and intramolecular DNA quadruplexes.
