Oligonucleotides incorporating 2'-deoxytubercidin (1a), its 2-amino derivative 2a and related 2-, or 7-substituted analogs (1d, 2b-d, 3 and 4) are synthesized. For this purpose, a series of novel phosphoramidites are prepared and employed in solid-phase synthesis. Hybridization experiments performed with 12mer duplexes indicate that 7-halogenated nucleosides enhance the duplex stability both in antiparallel and parallel DNA, whereas 2-fluorinated 7-deaza-2'-deoxyadenosine residues destabilize the duplex structure. The 7-deazaadenine nucleosides 1a, 1d and their 2-amino derivatives 2a-d form stable base pairs with dT but also with dC and dG. The mispairing with dC is pH-dependent. Ambiguous base pairing is observed at pH 7 or under acid conditions, whereas base discrimination occurs in alkaline medium (pH 8.0). This results from protonated base pairs formed between 1a or 2a and dC under neutral or acid condition, which are destroyed in alkaline medium. It is underlined by the increased basicity of the pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine nucleosides over that of the parent purine compounds (pK(a) values: 1a = 5.30; 2a = 5.71; dA = 3.50).
