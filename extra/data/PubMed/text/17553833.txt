Protein domain prediction is important for protein structure prediction, structure determination, function annotation, mutagenesis analysis and protein engineering. Here we describe an accurate protein domain prediction server (DOMAC) combining both template-based and ab initio methods. The preliminary version of the server was ranked among the top domain prediction servers in the seventh edition of Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP7), 2006. DOMAC server and datasets are available at: http://www.bioinfotool.org/domac.html.
