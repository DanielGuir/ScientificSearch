Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) code for several proteins that inhibit the presentation of antigenic peptides to CD8 T cells. Although the molecular mechanisms of CMV interference with the major histocompatibility complex class I pathway are long understood, surprisingly little evidence exists to support a role in vivo. Here we document the first example of the presentation of an antigenic peptide being blocked by a CMV immune evasion protein in organs relevant to CMV disease. Although this Db-restricted peptide, which is derived from the antiapoptotic protein M45 of murine CMV (mCMV), is classified as an immunodominant peptide based on response magnitude and long-term memory, adoptive transfer of M45 epitope-specific CD8 T cells did not protect against infection with wild-type mCMV. Notably, the same cells protected C57BL/6 mice infected with an mCMV mutant in which immune evasion protein m152/gp40 is deleted. These data indicate that direct presentation or cross-presentation of an antigenic peptide by professional antigen-presenting cells can efficiently prime CD8 T cells that fail in protection against CMV organ disease because m152/gp40 prevents presentation of this peptide in pathogenetically relevant tissue cells.
