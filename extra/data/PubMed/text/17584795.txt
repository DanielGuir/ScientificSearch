BioInformatics Pipeline Alternative Splicing Services (BIPASS) offer support to scientists interested in gathering information related to alternative splicing (AS) events. The service BIPAS-SpliceDB provides access to AS information that has been extracted a priori from various public databases and stored in a data warehouse. In contrast, the BIPAS-Align&Splice service allows scientists to submit their own sequences and genome to compute AS analysis results. BIPAS services offer various user-friendly ways to navigate through the results. AS results are organized at different conceptual levels (clusters and sequences), and are displayed in graphs or summarized in tables that can be downloaded in XML or text format. The two BIPAS services SpliceDB and Align&Splice are available online at http://bip.umiacs.umd.edu:8080/.
