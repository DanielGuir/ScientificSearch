We report an optimized synthesis of all canonical 2'-O-TOM protected ribonucleoside phosphoramidites and solid supports containing [13C5]-labeled ribose moieties, their sequence-specific introduction into very short RNA sequences and their use for the structure determination of two protein-RNA complexes. These specifically labeled sequences facilitate RNA resonance assignments and are essential to assign a high number of sugar-sugar and intermolecular NOEs, which ultimately improve the precision and accuracy of the resulting structures. This labeling strategy is particularly useful for the study of protein-RNA complexes with single-stranded RNA in solution, which is rapidly an increasingly relevant research area in biology.
