Several arguments suggest that minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) results from yet unknown systemic disorder of T cell function. By screening a cDNA library from T cell relapse, we identified a new pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing protein encoded by a gene located on chromosome 16q24. Two alternative transcripts were identified. The first species (c-mip) was expressed in fetal liver, kidney, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but weakly detected in PBMCs from MCNS patients. The second form (Tc-mip, standing for truncated c-maf inducing protein), corresponds to subtracted transcript and lacks the NH2-terminal PH domain. The expression of Tc-mip was restricted to fetal liver, thymus, and MCNS PBMCs where it was specifically recruited in CD4+ T cells subset. Overexpression of Tc-mip in T cell Jurkat induced c-maf, transactivated the interleukin 4 gene and down-regulated the interferon gamma expression, characteristic of a Th2 commitment. Moreover, the overexpression of Tc-mip induced Src phosphorylation, T cell clustering, and a cellular redistribution of the cytoskeleton-associated L-plastin, by a PI3 kinase independent pathway. Tc-mip represents therefore the first identified protein, which links proximal signaling to c-maf induction.
