Probalign computes maximal expected accuracy multiple sequence alignments from partition function posterior probabilities. To date, Probalign is among the very best scoring methods on the BAliBASE, HOMSTRAD and OXBENCH benchmarks. Here, we introduce eProbalign, which is an online implementation of the approach. Moreover, the eProbalign web server doubles as an online platform for post-alignment analysis. The heart-and-soul of the post-alignment functionality is the Probalign Alignment Viewer applet, which provides users a convenient means to manipulate the alignments by posterior probabilities. The viewer can also be used to produce graphical and text versions of the output. The eProbalign web server and underlying Probalign source code is freely accessible at http://probalign.njit.edu.
