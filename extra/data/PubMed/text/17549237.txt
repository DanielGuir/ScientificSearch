Diabetes mellitus, DM, is commonly accompanied with various stages of hemorheologic disturbances that are the main causes of the development of chronic DM. In this study, simple Chinese material medica [yang-yin jiang-tang preparation (YYJT)] was given to alloxan-induced DM rats and analyzed to compare the changes of fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), hemorheologic parameters and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) before and after administration. The results suggested that YYJT can significantly downregulate FBG (P < 0.005), improve insulin resistance and beta-cell secretion (P < 0.05), decrease whole blood viscosity at low and high shear rates, gathering of blood index test (GIT) and fibrinogen (FIB) (P < 0.05), and enlarge the function of IGF-II (P < 0.05). We concluded that YYJT could prevent and treat hemorheologic disorder in DM rats by means of reducing glucose, improving insulin resistance and elevating IGF-II.
