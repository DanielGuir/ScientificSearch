The pSSVx genetic element from Sulfolobus islandicus REY15/4 is a hybrid between a plasmid and a fusellovirus, able to be maintained in non-integrative form and to spread when the helper SSV2 virus is present in the cells. In this work, the satellite virus was engineered to obtain an Escherichia coli-Sulfolobus solfataricus shuttle vector for gene transfer and expression in S.solfataricus by fusing site-specifically the pSSVx chromosome with an E.coli plasmid replicon and the ampicillin resistance gene. The pSSVx-based vector was proven functional like the parental virus, namely it was able to spread efficiently through infected S.solfataricus cells. Moreover, the hybrid plasmid stably transformed S.solfataricus and propagated with no rearrangement, recombination or integration into the host chromosome. The high copy number of the artificial genetic element was found comparable with that calculated for the wild-type pSSVx in the new host cells, with no need of genetic markers for vector maintenance in the cells and for transfomant enrichment. The newly constructed vector was also shown to be an efficient cloning vehicle for the expression of passenger genes in S.solfataricus. In fact, a derivative plasmid carrying an expression cassette of the lacS gene encoding the beta-glycosidase from S.solfataricus under the control of the Sulfolobus chaperonine (thermosome tf55) heat shock promoter was also able to drive the expression of a functional enzyme. Complementation of the beta-galactosidase deficiency in a deletion mutant strain of S.solfataricus demonstrated that lacS gene was an efficient marker for selection of single transformants on solid minimal lactose medium.
