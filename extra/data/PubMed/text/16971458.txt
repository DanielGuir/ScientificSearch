Chloroplast-derived signals control a subset of nuclear genes in higher plants and eukaryotic algae. Among the types of signals identified are intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthesis such as Mg-protoporphyrin IX (MgProto). In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, it was suggested that this tetrapyrrole mediates the light induction of chaperone gene HSP70A. Here we have analyzed cis elements involved in the regulation of HSP70A by MgProto and light. We identified two promoters and between their transcription start sites two regulatory regions that each may confer inducibility by MgProto and light to both HSP70A promoters. These regulatory regions, when cloned in front of basal non-light inducible heterologous promoters, conferred inducibility by MgProto and light. The orientation and distance independent function of these cis-regulatory sequences qualifies them as enhancers that mediate the response of nuclear genes to a chloroplast signal. Mutational analysis of one of these regulatory regions and an alignment with promoters of other MgProto-inducible genes revealed the sequence motif (G/C)CGA(C/T)N(A/G)N15 (T/C/A)(A/T/G) which, as shown for HSP70A, may confer MgProto responsiveness. This cis-acting sequence element is employed for induction of HSP70A by both MgProto and light, lending support to the model that light induction of this gene is mediated via MgProto.
