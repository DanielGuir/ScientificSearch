Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) likely initiates immunoglobulin gene-conversion (GC) by deaminating cytidines within the V-region of chicken B-cells. However, the intervening DNA lesion required to initiate GC remains elusive. GC could be initiated by a single strand break or a double strand break (DSB). To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined GC in the chicken DT40 B cell line deficient in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). It is known that the NHEJ and homologous recombination DNA repair pathways compete for DSBs. In light of this, if a DSB is the major intermediate, deficiency in NHEJ should result in increased levels of GC. Here we show that DNA-PKcs(-/-/-) and Ku70(-/-) DT40 cells had 5- to 10-fold higher levels of GC relative to wildtype DT40 as measured by surface IgM reversion and sequencing of the V-region. These data suggest that a DSB is the major DNA lesion that initiates GC.
