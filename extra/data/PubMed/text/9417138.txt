The effects of intercellular coupling conductance on the activity of two electrically coupled isolated rabbit sinoatrial nodal cells were investigated. A computer-controlled version of the "coupling clamp" technique was used in which isolated sinoatrial nodal cells, not physically in contact with each other, were electrically coupled at various values of ohmic coupling conductance, mimicking the effects of mutual interaction by electrical coupling through gap junctional channels. We demonstrate the existence of four types of electrical behavior of coupled spontaneously active cells. As the coupling conductance is progressively increased, the cells exhibit: (a) independent pacemaking at low coupling conductances, (b) complex dynamics of activity with mutual interactions, (c) entrainment of action potential frequency at a 1:1 ratio with different action potential waveforms, and (d) entrainment of action potentials at the same frequency of activation and virtually identical action potential waveforms. The critical value of coupling conductance required for 1:1 frequency entrainment was <0.5 nS in each of the five cell pairs studied. The common interbeat interval at a relatively high coupling conductance (10 nS), which is sufficient to produce entrainment of frequency and also identical action potential waveforms, is determined most by the intrinsically faster pacemaker cell and it can be predicted from the diastolic depolarization times of both cells. Evidence is provided that, at low coupling conductances, mutual pacemaker synchronization results mainly from the phase-resetting effects of the action potential of one cell on the depolarization phase of the other. At high coupling conductances, the tonic, diastolic interactions become more important.
