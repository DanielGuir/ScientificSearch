During mitosis, chromosome condensation takes place, which entails the conversion of interphase chromatin into compacted mitotic chromosomes. Condensin I is a five-subunit protein complex that plays a central role in this process. Condensin I is targeted to chromosomes in a mitosis-specific manner, which is regulated by phosphorylation by mitotic kinases. Phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (Ser10) occurs during mitosis and its physiological role is a longstanding question. We examined the function of Aurora B, a kinase that phosphorylates Ser10, in the chromosomal binding of condensin I and mitotic chromosome condensation, using an in vitro system derived from Xenopus egg extract. Aurora B depletion from a mitotic egg extract resulted in the loss of H3 phosphorylation, accompanied with a 50% reduction of chromosomal targeting of condensin I. Alternatively, a portion of condensin I was bound to sperm chromatin, and chromosome-like structures were assembled when okadaic acid (OA) was supplemented in an interphase extract that lacks Cdc2 activity. However, chromosomal targeting of condensin I was abolished when Aurora B was depleted from the OA-treated interphase extract. From these results, it is suggested that Aurora B-dependent and Cdc2-independent pathways of the chromosomal targeting of condensin I are present.
