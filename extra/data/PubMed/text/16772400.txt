A direct and label-free electrochemical biosensor for the detection of the protein-mismatched DNA interaction was designed using immobilized N-terminal histidine tagged Escherichia coli. MutS on a Ni-NTA coated Au electrode. General electrochemical methods, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) and impedance spectroscopy, were used to ascertain the binding affinity of mismatched DNAs to the MutS probe. The direct results of CV and impedance clearly reveal that the interaction of MutS with the CC heteroduplex was much stronger than that with AT homoduplex, which was not differentiated in previous results (GT > CT > CC approximately AT) of a gel mobility shift assay. The EQCM technique was also able to quantitatively analyze MutS affinity to heteroduplexes.
