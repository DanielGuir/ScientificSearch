To aid navigation through this growing resource, all link entries contain a brief synopsis, a citation list and are classified by function in descriptive biological categories. The most up-to-date version of this actively maintained listing of bioinformatics resources is available at the Bioinformatics Links Directory website, http://bioinformatics.ubc.ca/resources/links_directory/. A complete list of all links listed in this Nucleic Acids Research 2006 Web Server issue can be accessed online at http://bioinformatics.ubc.ca/resources/links_directory/narweb2006/.
