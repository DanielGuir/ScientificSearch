The endonuclease MUS81 has been shown in a variety of organisms to be involved in DNA repair in mitotic and meiotic cells. Homologues of the MUS81 gene exist in the genomes of all eukaryotes, pointing to a conserved role of the protein. However, the biological role of MUS81 varies between different eukaryotes. For example, while loss of the gene results in strongly impaired fertility in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and nearly complete sterility in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, it is not essential for meiosis in mammals. We identified a functional homologue (AtMUS81/At4g30870) in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana and isolated a full-length cDNA of this gene. Analysing two independent T-DNA insertion lines of AtMUS81, we found that they are sensitive to the mutagens MMS and MMC. Both mutants have a deficiency in homologous recombination in somatic cells but only after induction by genotoxic stress. In contrast to yeast, no meiotic defect of AtMUS81 mutants was detectable and the mutants are viable. Crosses with a hyperrecombinogenic mutant of the AtRecQ4A helicase resulted in synthetic lethality in the double mutant. Thus, the nuclease AtMUS81 and the helicase AtRecQ4A seem to be involved in two alternative pathways of resolution of replicative DNA structures in somatic cells.
