The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identifies sets of genes that are differentially regulated in one direction. Many homeostatic systems will include one limb that is upregulated in response to a downregulation of another limb and vice versa. Such patterns are poorly captured by the standard formulation of GSEA. We describe a technique to identify groups of genes (which sometimes can be pathways) that include both up- and down-regulated components. This approach lends insights into the feedback mechanisms that may operate, especially when integrated with protein interaction databases.
