We analyzed the kinetics of interaction between the peptide KIFMK, containing the isoleucine, phen-ylalanine, and methionine (IFM) motif from the inactivation gate, and the brain type IIA sodium channels with a mutation that disrupts inactivation (F1489Q). The on-rate constant was concentration dependent, consistent with a bimolecular reaction with open sodium channels, while the off rates were unaffected by changes in the KIFMK concentration. The apparent Kd was approximately 33 microM at 0 mV. The on rates were voltage dependent, supporting the hypothesis that one or both of the charges in KIFMK enter the membrane electric field. The voltage dependence of block was consistent with the equivalent movement of approximately 0.6 electronic charges across the membrane. In contrast, the off rates were voltage independent. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the KIFMK peptide enters the pore of the open sodium channel from the intracellular side and blocks it.
