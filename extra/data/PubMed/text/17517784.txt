RADAR is a web server that provides a multitude of functionality for RNA data analysis and research. It can align structure-annotated RNA sequences so that both sequence and structure information are taken into consideration during the alignment process. This server is capable of performing pairwise structure alignment, multiple structure alignment, database search and clustering. In addition, RADAR provides two salient features: (i) constrained alignment of RNA secondary structures, and (ii) prediction of the consensus structure for a set of RNA sequences. RADAR will be able to assist scientists in performing many important RNA mining operations, including the understanding of the functionality of RNA sequences, the detection of RNA structural motifs and the clustering of RNA molecules, among others. The web server together with a software package for download is freely accessible at http://datalab.njit.edu/biodata/rna/RSmatch/server.htm and http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~bshapiro/
