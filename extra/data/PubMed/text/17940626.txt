Although metastases within the thyroid gland are rare, they are not as infrequent as generally believed. Asymptomatic breast, lung, and renal cell carcinomas may metastasize to the thyroid. When they become symptomatic, diagnosis relies upon fine needle aspiration cytology. We report the case of a squamous cell cervical cancer that presented metastatic lesions to the thyroid gland four years after the initial diagnosis. The procedures used to confirm the diagnosis, stage, and subsequently manage the patient are described. We present both a review of the necessary clinical investigation and the therapeutic options open to these patients. We conclude that patients who present swelling or palpable nodules in the thyroid side and have a history of a previous malignancy must be considered for metastatic disease.
