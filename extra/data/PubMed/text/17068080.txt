Dlx2, Lymphoid Enhancer Factor (Lef-1) and Msx2 transcription factors are required for several developmental processes. To understand the control of gene expression by these factors, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays identified Msx2 as a downstream target of Dlx2 and Lef-1. Dlx2 activates the Msx2 promoter in several cell lines and binds DNA as a monomer and dimer. A Lef-1 beta-catenin-dependent isoform minimally activates the Msx2 promoter and a Lef-1 beta-catenin-independent isoform is inactive, however co-expression of Dlx2 and both Lef-1 isoforms synergistically activate the Msx2 promoter. Co-immunoprecipitation and protein pull-down experiments demonstrate Lef-1 physically interacts with Dlx2. Deletion analyses of the Lef-1 protein reveal specific regions required for synergism with Dlx2. The Lef-1 beta-catenin binding domain (betaDB) is not required for its interaction with Dlx2. Msx2 can auto-regulate its promoter and repress Dlx2 activation. Msx2 repression of Dlx2 activation is dose-specific and both bind a common DNA-binding element. These transcriptional mechanisms correlate with the temporal and spatial expression of these factors and may provide a mechanism for the control of several developmental processes. We demonstrate new transcriptional activities for Dlx2, Msx2 and Lef-1 through protein interactions and identification of downstream targets.
