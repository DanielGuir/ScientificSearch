RNAi efficiency is influenced by local RNA structure of the target sequence. We studied this structure-based resistance in detail by targeting a perfect RNA hairpin and subsequently destabilized its tight structure by mutation, thereby gradually exposing the target sequence. Although the tightest RNA hairpins were completely resistant to RNAi, we observed an inverse correlation between the overall target hairpin stability and RNAi efficiency within a specific thermodynamic stability (DeltaG) range. Increased RNAi efficiency was shown to be caused by improved binding of the siRNA to the destabilized target RNA hairpins. The mutational effects vary for different target regions. We find an accessible target 3' end to be most important for RNAi-mediated inhibition. However, these 3' end effects cannot be reproduced in siRNA-target RNA-binding studies in vitro, indicating the important role of RISC components in the in vivo RNAi reaction. The results provide a more detailed insight into the impact of target RNA structure on RNAi and we discuss several possible implications. With respect to lentiviral-mediated delivery of shRNA expression cassettes, we present a DeltaG window to destabilize the shRNA insert for vector improvement, while avoiding RNAi-mediated self-targeting during lentiviral vector production.
