The Pcons.net Meta Server (http://pcons.net) provides improved automated tools for protein structure prediction and analysis using consensus. It essentially implements all the steps necessary to produce a high quality model of a protein. The whole process is fully automated and a potential user only submits the protein sequence. For PSI-BLAST detectable targets, an accurate model is generated within minutes of submission. For more difficult targets the sequence is automatically submitted to publicly available fold-recognition servers that use more advanced approaches to find distant structural homologs. The results from these servers are analyzed and assessed for structural correctness using Pcons and ProQ; and the user is presented with a ranked list of possible models. In addition, if the protein sequence contains more than one domain, these are automatically parsed out and resubmitted to the server as individual queries.
