Lipid bodies form autonomous intracellular structures in many model cells and in some cells of specific tissue origin. They contain hydrophobic substances, a set of structural proteins such as perilipin or adipose differentiation-related protein, enzymes implicated in lipid metabolism, and proteins that participate in signaling and membrane trafficking. Retinosomes, particles reminiscent of lipid bodies, have been identified in retinal pigment epithelium as distinct structures compartmentalizing a metabolic intermediate involved in regeneration of the visual chromophore. These observations suggest that lipid bodies, including retinosomes, carry out specific functions that go beyond those of mere lipid storage organelles.
