The biophysical properties of oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) selectively modified with conformationally 'locked' bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane pseudosugars (Maier,M.A., Choi,Y., Gaus,H., Barchi,J.J. Jr, Marquez,V.E., Manoharan,M. (2004) Synthesis and characterization of oligonucleotides containing conformationally constrained bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane pseudosugar analogs Nucleic Acids Res., 32, 3642-3650) have been studied by various techniques. Six separate synthetic ODNs based on the Dickerson Drew dodecamer sequence (CGCGAAT*T*CGCG) were examined where each one (or both) of the thymidines (T*) were substituted with a bicyclic pseudosugar locked in either a North (2'-exo) or South (3'-exo) ring pucker. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and (1)H NMR spectroscopy were used to examine the duplex stability and conformational properties of the ODNs. Replacement of one or both thymidines with North-locked sugars (RNA-like) into the dodecamer did not greatly affect duplex formation or melt temperatures but distinct differences in thermodynamic parameters were observed. In contrast, incorporation of South-locked sugar derivatives that were predicted to stabilize this standard B-DNA, had the unexpected effect of causing a conformational equilibrium between different duplex forms at specific strand and salt concentrations. Our data and those of others suggest that although DNA can tolerate modifications with RNA-like (North) nucleotides, a more complicated spectrum of changes emerges with modifications restricted to South (DNA-like) puckers.
