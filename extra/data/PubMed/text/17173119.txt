Antigen S-100B of nervous tissue, according to the data of numerous studies, affects the mechanisms of nervous system plasticity and memory. The influence of ultralow doses of antibodies to S-100B (6C dilution, according to the homeopathic pharmacopoeia) has been studied on three learning behavioral models on Wistar rats, which were inhibitory avoidance, choosing of bowls with sucrose and feeding behavior cessation after auditory signal. For all three tasks, parameters of reproduction of the learned skills improved after per oral administration of potentiated antibodies to S-100B antigen immediately after learning. Possible mechanisms of the anti-S-100B antibodies influence on memory formation are discussed.
