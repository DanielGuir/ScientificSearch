Four compounds beta-sitosterol, beta-sitosterol-3-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside, ursolic acid and 4',5,6-trihydroxy-3', 7-dimethoxyflavone were characterized from the dichloromethane extract of the aerial parts of Satureja khuzistanica (Lamiaceae), a native medicinal plant growing in Iran, on the basis of spectral analysis and comparing with the data in literature. The natural occurrence of these compounds can be conclusive for the chemotaxonomic characterization of the genus Satureja.
