L-DNA is the perfect mirror-image form of the naturally occurring d-conformation of DNA. Therefore, L-DNA duplexes have the same physical characteristics in terms of solubility, duplex stability and selectivity as D-DNA but form a left-helical double-helix. Because of its chiral difference, L-DNA does not bind to its naturally occurring D-DNA counterpart, however. We analysed some of the properties that are typical for L-DNA. For all the differences, L-DNA is chemically compatible with the D-form of DNA, so that chimeric molecules can be synthesized. We take advantage of the characteristics of L-DNA toward the establishment of a universal microarray that permits the analysis of different kinds of molecular diagnostic information in a single experiment on a single platform, in various combinations. Typical results for the measurement of transcript level variations, genotypic differences and DNA-protein interactions are presented. However, on the basis of the characteristic features of L-DNA, also other applications of this molecule type are discussed.
