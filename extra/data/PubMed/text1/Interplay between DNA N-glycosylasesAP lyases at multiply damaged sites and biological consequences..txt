Evidence has emerged that repair of clustered DNA lesions may be compromised, possibly leading to the formation of double-strand breaks (DSB) and, thus, to deleterious events. The first repair event occurring at a multiply damaged site (MDS) is of major importance and will largely contribute to the hazardousness of MDS. Here, using protein extracts from wild type or hOGG1-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells, we investigated the initial incision rate at base damage and the formation of repair intermediates in various complex MDS. These MDS comprise a 1 nt gap and 3-4 base damage, including 8-oxoguanine (oG) and 5-hydroxyuracil (hU). We report a hierarchy in base excision that mainly depends on the nature and the distribution of the damage. We also show that excision at both oG and hU, and consequently DSB formation, can be modulated by hOGG1 overexpression. Anyhow, for all the MDS analyzed, DSB formation is limited, due to impaired base excision. Interestingly, repair intermediates contain a short single-stranded region carrying a potentially mutagenic base damage. This in vitro study provides new insight into the processing of MDS and suggests that repair intermediates resulting from the processing of such MDS are rather mutagenic than toxic.
