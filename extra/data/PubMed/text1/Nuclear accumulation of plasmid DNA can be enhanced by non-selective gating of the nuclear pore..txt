One of the major obstacles in non-viral gene transfer is the nuclear membrane. Attempts to improve the transport of DNA to the nucleus through the use of nuclear localization signals or importin-beta have achieved limited success. It has been proposed that the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) through which nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs are filled with a hydrophobic phase through which hydrophobic importins can dissolve. Therefore, considering the hydrophobic nature of the NPC channel, we evaluated whether a non-selective gating of nuclear pores by trans-cyclohexane-1,2-diol (TCHD), an amphipathic alcohol that reversibly collapses the permeability barrier of the NPCs, could be obtained and used as an alternative method to facilitate nuclear entry of plasmid DNA. Our data demonstrate for the first time that TCHD makes the nucleus permeable for both high molecular weight dextrans and plasmid DNA (pDNA) at non-toxic concentrations. Furthermore, in line with these observations, TCHD enhanced the transfection efficacy of both naked DNA and lipoplexes. In conclusion, based on the proposed structure of NPCs we succeeded to temporarily open the NPCs for macromolecules as large as pDNAs and demonstrated that this can significantly enhance non-viral gene delivery.
