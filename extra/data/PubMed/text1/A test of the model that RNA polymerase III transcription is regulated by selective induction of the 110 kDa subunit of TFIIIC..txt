TFIIIC is a RNA polymerase (pol) III-specific DNA-binding factor that is required for transcription of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes. Active human TFIIIC consists of five subunits. However, an inactive form has also been isolated that lacks one of the five subunits, called TFIIIC110. A model was proposed in which pol III transcription might be regulated by the specific induction of TFIIIC110, allowing formation of active TFIIIC from the inactive form. We have tested this model by transient transfection of HeLa and HEK293 cells with a vector expressing TFIIIC110. We have also made stably transfected HeLa cell lines that carry a doxycycline-inducible version of the cDNA for TFIIIC110. We show that the induced TFIIIC110 enters the nucleus, binds other TFIIIC subunits and is recruited to tRNA and 5S rRNA genes in vivo. However, little or no effect is seen on the expression of pol III transcripts. The data argue against the model that pol III transcription can be effectively modulated through the specific induction of TFIIIC110.
