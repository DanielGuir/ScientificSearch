DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly cytotoxic lesions formed by a variety of important anti-tumor agents. Despite the clinical importance of ICLs, the mechanisms by which these lesions are repaired in mammalian cells have so far remained elusive. One of the obstacles in the study of ICL repair has been the limited availability of suitable methods for the synthesis of defined site-specific ICLs. We report here the synthesis of a site-specific ICL containing an ethylene-bridged G-T base pair based on the incorporation of a crosslink precursor containing a selectively reactive group on one strand using solid-phase synthesis. 3-(2-chloroethyl)thymidine was incorporated into oligonucleotides and underwent ICL formation upon annealing to a complementary strand by reacting with the base opposite to the modified T residue. A strong preference for ICL formation with a G residue opposite the reactive T was observed. Detailed characterization of the reaction product revealed that the alkylation reaction occurred with the O-6 group of G and a mechanism accounting for this preference is proposed. These G-T crosslinks introduced here will be useful for studies of ICL repair.
