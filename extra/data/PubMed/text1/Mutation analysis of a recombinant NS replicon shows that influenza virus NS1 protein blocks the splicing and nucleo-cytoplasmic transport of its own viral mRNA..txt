The genome of influenza A virus consists of eight single-stranded RNA molecules of negative polarity. Their replication and transcription take place in the nucleus of infected cells using ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) as templates. Two of the viral transcripts, those generated by RNPs 7 and 8, can be spliced and lead to two alternative protein products (M1 and M2, NS1 and NEP/NS2, respectively). Previous studies have shown that when expressed from cDNA, NS1 protein alters the splicing and transport of RNA polymerase II-driven transcripts. Here we used a transient replication/transcription system, in which RNP 8 is replicated and transcribed by recombinant RNA and proteins, to study the splicing and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of true viral transcripts. Our results show that the encoded NS1 protein inhibits the splicing of the collinear transcript. This regulation is mediated by the N-terminal region of the protein but does not involve its RNA-binding activity. We also show that NS1 protein preferentially blocks the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of the collinear RNP 8 transcript in an RNA-binding dependent manner. These results rule out previous models to explain the regulation of mRNA processing and transport by NS1 and underlines the relevance of NS1 protein in the control of virus gene expression.
