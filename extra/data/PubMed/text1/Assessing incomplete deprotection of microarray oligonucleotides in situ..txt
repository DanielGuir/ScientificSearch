En masse analysis of gene structure and function by array technologies will have a lasting and profound effect on biology and medicine. This impact can be compromised by low quality of probes within arrays, which we show can be caused by incomplete removal of chemical protecting groups. To solve this quality control problem, we present a sensitive, specific and facile method to detect these groups in situ on arrays using monoclonal antibodies and existing instrumentation. Screening of microarrays with these monoclonal antibodies should guide the consideration given to data derived from these and should enhance the accuracy of the results obtained.
