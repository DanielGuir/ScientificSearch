Non-caloric nutrients (NCN) are extremely numerous and it is more than obvious that they work in a team relationship. These vitally important interactions are, for the most part, poorly understood. These brief case reports illustrate this in the therapeutic use of thiamin in a clinical setting. The initially abnormal erythrocyte transketolase activity (TKA) and/or the thiamin pyrophosphate effect (TPPE), indicating intracellular cofactor deficiency, usually improves with thiamin administration. Biochemical correction of the abnormality is, however, invariably dependent on the provision of other NCN, especially magnesium. In two patients reported here, this correction required several infusions containing magnesium and other NCN administered intravenously. In a third patient, hemoconcentration associated with an abnormal TPPE was normalized after administration of nutrients that included thiamin and magnesium.
