Metagenomics has been employed to systematically sequence, classify, analyze and manipulate the entire genetic material isolated from environmental samples. Finding genes within metagenomic sequences remains a formidable challenge, and noncoding RNA genes other than those encoding rRNA and tRNA are not well annotated in metagenomic projects. In this work, we identify, validate and analyze the genes coding for RNase P RNA (P RNA) from all published metagenomic projects. P RNA is the RNA subunit of a ubiquitous endoribonuclease RNase P that consists of one RNA subunit and one or more protein subunits. The bacterial P RNAs are classified into two types, Type A and Type B, based on the constituents of the structure involved in precursor tRNA binding. Archaeal P RNAs are classified into Type A and Type M, whereas the Type A is ancestral and close to Type A bacterial P RNA. Bacterial and some archaeal P RNAs are catalytically active without protein subunits, capable of cleaving precursor tRNA transcripts to produce their mature 5'-termini. We have found 328 distinctive P RNAs (320 bacterial and 8 archaeal) from all published metagenomics sequences, which led us to expand by 60% the total number of this catalytic RNA from prokaryotes. Surprisingly, all newly identified P RNAs from metagenomics sequences are Type A, i.e. neither Type B bacterial nor Type M archaeal P RNAs are found. We experimentally validate the authenticity of an archaeal P RNA from Sargasso Sea. One of the distinctive features of some new P RNAs is that the P2 stem has kinked nucleotides in its 5' strand. We find that the single nucleotide J2/3 joint region linking the P2 and P3 stem that was used to distinguish a bacterial P RNA from an archaeal one is no longer applicable, i.e. some archaeal P RNAs have only one nucleotide in the J2/3 joint. We also discuss the phylogenetic analysis based on covariance model of P RNA that offers a few advantages over the one based on 16S rRNA.
