Celiac disease (CD) and immunosuppression are the two risk factors for gastrointestinal, as well as non-gastrointestinal, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Recent large retrospective studies confirm that celiac disease significantly increases risk of developing small bowel lymphomas by 30 to 40 percent and other gut malignancies by 83-fold.
