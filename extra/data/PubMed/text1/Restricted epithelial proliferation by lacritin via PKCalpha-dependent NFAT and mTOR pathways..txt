Renewal of nongermative epithelia is poorly understood. The novel mitogen "lacritin" is apically secreted by several nongermative epithelia. We tested 17 different cell types and discovered that lacritin is preferentially mitogenic or prosecretory for those types that normally contact lacritin during its glandular outward flow. Mitogenesis is dependent on lacritin's C-terminal domain, which can form an alpha-helix with a hydrophobic face, as per VEGF's and PTHLP's respective dimerization or receptor-binding domain. Lacritin targets downstream NFATC1 and mTOR. The use of inhibitors or siRNA suggests that lacritin mitogenic signaling involves Galpha(i) or Galpha(o)-PKCalpha-PLC-Ca2+-calcineurin-NFATC1 and Galpha(i) or Galpha(o)-PKCalpha-PLC-phospholipase D (PLD)-mTOR in a bell-shaped, dose-dependent manner requiring the Ca2+ sensor STIM1, but not TRPC1. This pathway suggests the placement of transiently dephosphorylated and perinuclear Golgi-translocated PKCalpha upstream of both Ca2+ mobilization and PLD activation in a complex with PLCgamma2. Outward flow of lacritin from secretory cells through ducts may generate a proliferative/secretory field as a different unit of cellular renewal in nongermative epithelia where luminal structures predominate.
