The flap endonucleases (FENs) participate in a wide range of processes involving the structure-specific cleavage of branched nucleic acids. They are also able to hydrolyse DNA and RNA substrates from the 5'-end, liberating mono-, di- and polynucleotides terminating with a 5' phosphate. Exonuclease IX is a paralogue of the small fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, a FEN with which it shares 66% similarity. Here we show that both glutathione-S-transferase-tagged and native recombinant ExoIX are able to interact with the E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein, SSB. Immobilized ExoIX was able to recover SSB from E. coli lysates both in the presence and absence of DNA. In vitro cross-linking studies carried out in the absence of DNA showed that the SSB tetramer appears to bind up to two molecules of ExoIX. Furthermore, we found that a 3'-5' exodeoxyribonuclease activity previously associated with ExoIX can be separated from it by extensive liquid chromatography. The associated 3'-5' exodeoxyribonuclease activity was excised from a 2D gel and identified as exonuclease III using matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization mass spectrometry.
