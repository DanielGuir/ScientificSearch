The process of DNA replication includes duplex unwinding, followed immediately by DNA synthesis. In eukaryotes, DNA synthesis is disturbed in damaged DNA regions, in replication slow zones, or as a result of insufficient nucleotide level. This review aims to discuss the mechanisms that coordinate DNA unwinding and synthesis, allowing replication to be completed even in the presence of genomic insults. There is a growing body of evidence which suggests that S-phase checkpoint pathways regulate both replicative unwinding and DNA synthesis, to synchronize the two processes, thus ensuring genome stability.
