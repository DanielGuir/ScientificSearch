All pairwise interactions occurring between bases which could be detected in three-dimensional structures of crystallized RNA molecules are annotated on new planar diagrams. The diagrams attempt to map the underlying complex networks of base-base interactions and, especially, they aim at conveying key relationships between helical domains: co-axial stacking, bending and all Watson-Crick as well as non-Watson-Crick base pairs. Although such wiring diagrams cannot replace full stereographic images for correct spatial understanding and representation, they reveal structural similarities as well as the conserved patterns and distances between motifs which are present within the interaction networks of folded RNAs of similar or unrelated functions. Finally, the diagrams could help devising methods for meaningfully transforming RNA structures into graphs amenable to network analysis.
