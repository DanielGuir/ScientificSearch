The Multi-Q web server provides an automated data analysis tool for multiplexed protein quantitation based on the iTRAQ labeling method. The web server is designed as a platform that can accommodate various input data formats from search engines and mass spectrometer manufacturers. Compared to the previous stand-alone version, the new web server version provides many enhanced features and flexible options for quantitation. The workflow of the web server is represented by a quantitation wizard so that the tool is easy to use. It also provides a friendly interface that helps users configure their parameter settings before running the program. The web server generates a standard report for quantitation results. In addition, it allows users to customize their output reports and information of interest can be easily highlighted. The output also provides visualization of mass spectral data so that users can conveniently validate the results. The Multi-Q web server is a fully automated and easy to use quantitation tool that is suitable for large-scale multiplexed protein quantitation.
