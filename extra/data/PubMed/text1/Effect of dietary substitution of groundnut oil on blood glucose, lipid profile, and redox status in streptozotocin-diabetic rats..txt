The effect of groundnut oil on blood glucose, lipid profile, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant status in streptozotocin-diabetic rats was investigated and compared with diabetic and drug-treated rats. Diabetes was induced in adult female Wistar rats by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg b-wt). Normal and diabetic rats were fed an oil-free diet containing 2 percent oil supplemented with groundnut oil (6g per 94 g diet), to give 8 percent oil content, for 42 days. Diabetic rats had elevated levels of glucose (322.61 +/- 9.49), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), vitamin E, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and lipid hydroperoxides (HP) and decreased levels of hemoglobin (Hb), vitamin C, and reduced glutathione (GSH). An increase in the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and a decrease in hexokinase activity also were observed in the liver and kidney. When diabetic rats were fed groundnut oil, a significant reduction in glucose (244.04 +/- 11.66), HbA(1c), TBARS, HP levels, and glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activities and an elevation in Hb, vitamin E, GSH levels, and hexokinase activity were observed. Diabetic rats had elevated total cholesterol (TC), VLDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG) and decreased HDL-cholesterol. Diabetic rats fed groundnut oil showed a small but significant reduction in TC, VLDL-C, LDL-C, and TG and an elevation in HDL-C. Groundnut oil consumption slightly but significantly decreases the blood glucose, HbA(1c), lipid peroxidation, and lipid profile and increases antioxidant levels in diabetic rats.
