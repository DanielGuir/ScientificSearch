iHOP provides fast, accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date summary information on more than 80,000 biological molecules by automatically extracting key sentences from millions of PubMed documents. Its intuitive user interface and navigation scheme have made iHOP extremely successful among biologists, counting more than 500,000 visits per month (iHOP access statistics: http://www.ihop-net.org/UniPub/iHOP/info/logs/). Here we describe a public programmatic API that enables the integration of main iHOP functionalities in bioinformatic programs and workflows.
