Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on a paradigm of the body different to that of modern biomedicine. Inherent characteristics of TCM necessitate an active and central role of acupuncturists in acupuncture treatment. The author looks at acupuncture in the practical context and analyzes the role of acupuncturists in diagnostic process and treatment delivery. Acupuncture as a complex non-pharmacological therapy depends solely on the acupuncturists' skills, competence and understanding of TCM theory to work. More attention should be given to this important role of acupuncturists in either clinical practice or research on acupuncture.
