Although usually implicated in the stabilization of mRNAs in eukaryotes, polyadenylation was initially shown to destabilize RNA in bacteria. All the data are consistent with polyadenylation being part of a quality control process targeting folded RNA fragments and non-functional RNA molecules to degradation. We report here an example in Escherichia coli, where polyadenylation directly controls the level of expression of a gene by modulating the stability of a functional transcript. Inactivation of poly(A)polymerase I causes overexpression of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (GlmS) and both the accumulation and stabilization of the glmS transcript. Moreover, we show that the glmS mRNA results from the processing of the glmU-glmS cotranscript by RNase E. Interestingly, the glmU-glmS cotranscript and the mRNA fragment encoding GlmU only slightly accumulated in the absence of poly(A)polymerase, suggesting that the endonucleolytically generated glmS mRNA harbouring a 5' monophosphate and a 3' stable hairpin is highly susceptible to poly(A)-dependent degradation.
