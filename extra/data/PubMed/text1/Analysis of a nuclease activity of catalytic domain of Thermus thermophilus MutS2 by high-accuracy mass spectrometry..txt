Electrospray ionization with Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT ICR MS) is a powerful tool for analyzing the precise structural features of biopolymers, including oligonucleotides. Here, we described the detailed characterization of a newly discovered nuclease activity of the C-terminal domain of Thermus thermophilus MutS2 (ttMutS2). Using this method, the length, nucleotide content and nature of the 5'- and 3'-termini of the product oligonucleotides were accurately identified. It is revealed that the C-terminal domain of ttMutS2 incised the phosphate backbone of oligodeoxynucleotides non-sequence-specifically at the 3' side of the phosphates. The simultaneous identification of the innumerable fragments was achieved by the extremely high-accuracy of ESI-FT ICR MS.
