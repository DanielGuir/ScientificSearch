Here, we examined the effects of molecular crowding on the function, structure and stability of nucleases. We found that the hydrolysis of a 29-mer double-stranded DNA by the endonucleases DNase I and S1 nuclease was substantially enhanced by molecular crowding using polyethylene glycol (PEG); however, molecular crowding had little effect on hydrolysis by exo III and exo I exonucleases. Moreover, kinetic analysis showed that the maximum velocity for the reaction of DNase I at 25 degrees C was increased from 0.1 to 2.7 microM/min by molecular crowding with 20% (w/v) PEG, whereas that of exonuclease I at 37 degrees C decreased from 2.2 to 0.4 microM/min. In contrast, molecular crowding did not significantly affect the Michaelis constant of DNase I or exonuclease I. These results indicate that molecular crowding has different effects on the catalytic activities of exonucleases and endonucleases.
