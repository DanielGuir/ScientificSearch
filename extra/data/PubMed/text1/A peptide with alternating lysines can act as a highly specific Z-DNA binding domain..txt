Many nucleic acid binding proteins use short peptide sequences to provide specificity in recognizing their targets, which may be either a specific sequence or a conformation. Peptides containing alternating lysine have been shown to bind to poly(dG-d5meC) in the Z conformation, and stabilize the higher energy form [H. Takeuchi, N. Hanamura, H. Hayasaka and I. Harada (1991) FEBS Lett., 279, 253-255 and H. Takeuchi, N. Hanamura and I. Harada (1994) J. Mol. Biol., 236, 610-617.]. Here we report the construction of a Z-DNA specific binding protein, with the peptide KGKGKGK as a functional domain and a leucine zipper as a dimerization domain. The resultant protein, KGZIP, induces the Z conformation in poly(dG-d5meC) and binds to Z-DNA stabilized by bromination with high affinity and specificity. The binding of KGZIP is sufficient to convert poly(dG-d5meC) from the B to the Z form, as shown by circular dichroism. The sequence KGKGKGK is found in many proteins, although no functional role has been established. KGZIP also has potential for engineering other Z-DNA specific proteins for future studies of Z-DNA in vitro and in vivo.
